Efficiency and defense motivated ingroup projection: Sources of protoypicality in intergroup relations,Rosa,Miriam,2012,10.1016/j.jesp.2011.12.004,0022-1031,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,JournExpSocPsych,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,FALSE,"Rosa, Miriam; Waldzus, Sven",Efficiency and defense motivated ingroup projection: Sources of protoypicality in intergroup relations,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,English,Ingroup projection; Intergroup context; Information processing,RESPONSE-TIME EVIDENCE; IN-GROUP PROTOTYPICALITY; SOCIAL IDENTITY THREAT; SUPERORDINATE CATEGORY; GROUP IDENTIFICATION; PREMERGER STATUS; GAY MEN; MODEL; ATTITUDES; SELF,"Members of higher status groups generalize characteristics of their ingroup to superordinate categories that serve as a frame of reference for comparisons with outgroups (ingroup projection). We propose that the causal process depends on the security of the intergroup context: When intergroup relations are secure, projection derives from a motivation to represent the superordinate category efficiently; when they are insecure, projection is a defense motivated process. Accordingly, we hypothesized that inducing participants to use heuristic vs. systematic information processing (via time pressure, cognitive load, or thoughtfulness instructions) would have differential effects on ingroup projection in secure as compared to insecure intergroup relations. Three experiments manipulated security of the intergroup context and information processing mode in artificial (Studies 1 and 2) or natural (Study 3) groups. We found that time pressure increased ingroup projection in the secure-group condition but decreased it in the insecure-group condition (Study 1), cognitive load increased projection in the secure but not in the insecure condition (Study 2) and thoughtfulness instructions increased projection for high identifiers in the insecure but not in the secure condition (Study 3). Results support the hypothesis that ingroup projection occurs as a cognitive bias in secure intergroup relations but that it is socially motivated by the specific intergroup relation when this relation is insecure.

We further propose that competitive interorganizational relations enhance the hypothesized relationships. Three studies conducted in China and the United States using both survey and vignette methodologies provided convergent support for our model. Study 1 revealed that higher organizational identifiers engaged in more UPB, and that this effect was mediated by moral disengagement. Study 2 found that organizational identification once again predicted UPB through the mediation of moral disengagement, and that the mediation relationship was stronger when employees perceived a higher level of industry competition. Finally, Study 3 replicated the above findings using a vignette experiment to provide stronger evidence of causality.

Employees' interpretation of CSR is important because of the paradoxical nature of CSR. When firms operate in ways that seem counter to their nature (i.e., pursuit of social good rather than profit), the causal attributions of affected employees are crucial to understanding their work-related behavior, as is the role of contextual factors such as leadership processes in shaping these attributions. Drawing from attribution and social learning theories, we develop a multilevel social influence theory of how CSR affects employees. We integrate managers as second observers in the baseline actor (i.e., firm)observer (i.e., employee) dyad, whereas most attribution theory research has focused on single actor-observer dyads. Multisource field data collected from 427 employees and 45 managers were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. Managers' genuine (self-serving) CSR attributions are positively related to employees' genuine (self-serving) CSR attributions; and the strength of the relationship between managers' and employees' genuine CSR attributions depends on managers' organizational tenure. Employees' genuine CSR attributions also are positively related to employee advocacy, whereasinterestinglyemployees' self-serving CSR attributions do not appear to harm employee advocacy.

Higher accuracy is typically found for identifying the letter on the left, which has been attributed to a right-hemisphere dominance for selective attention. Here, we use rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of letters in two locations at once. The letters to be identified are simultaneous and cued by rings. In the first experiment, we manipulated implied reading direction by rotating or mirror-reversing the letters to face to the left rather than to the right. The left-side performance advantage was eliminated. In the second experiment, letters were positioned above and below fixation, oriented such that they appeared to face downward (90 degrees clockwise rotation) or upward (90 degrees counterclockwise rotation). Again consistent with an effect of implied reading direction, performance was better for the top position in the downward condition, but not in the upward condition. In both experiments, mixture modeling of participants' report errors revealed that attentional sampling from the two locations was approximately simultaneous, ruling out the theory that the letter on one side was processed first, followed by a shift of attention to sample the other letter. Thus, the orientation of the letters apparently controls not when the letters are sampled from the scene, but rather the dynamics of a subsequent process, such as tokenization or memory consolidation.

The authors investigated how coupled individuals allocated time together, alone, with children, and as a family, exploring changes between 1990 and 2010 in Sweden using three waves of the Swedish Time Use Survey (N = 9,544). Ordinary least squares and decomposition analyses find a trend toward time together over time alone, with childless couples spending similar time together and parents increasing family time. The shift toward family time evolved differently for men and women, indicating gender convergence in private and public spheres, but at higher costs of time alone for women. Change is behavioral and general, applying quite equally across gender and educational groups. There are educational gradients concerning time with children and certain qualitative aspects of time together, indicating that dual-earner society may be family friendly, but not equally for all.","[Neilson, Jeffrey; Stanfors, Maria] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden","Stanfors, M (reprint author), Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",maria.stanfors@ekh.lu.se,"Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare [2014-0098]; Center for Economic Demography at Lund University",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2445,1741-3737,2018,80,1,10.1111/jomf.12414,Family Studies; Sociology,Family Studies; Sociology,WOS:000419827900005,80-98,Neilson,Jeffrey,18-Feb,Neilson_JournMarFam_2018_jm1b8.pdf,"Ordinary least squares and decom- position analyses find a trend toward time together over time alone, with childless couples spending similar time together and parents increasing family time.","Ordinary least squares and decom- position analyses find a trend toward time together over time alone, with childless couples spending similar time together and parents increasing family time.",0,1,514,(x1: 70.72 y1: 354.75) (x2: 128.75 y2: 404.07),"Our time-use analysis, how- ever, does not uncover widespread declines in spousal interaction or decreased family orien- tation but, in fact, finds evidence of increased family orientation.","Our time-use analysis, how- ever, does not uncover widespread declines in spousal interaction or decreased family orien- tation but, in fact, finds evidence of increased family orientation.",1,15,773,(x1: 109.51 y1: 294.43) (x2: 114.03 y2: 343.84),"After 1990–1991, family time increased for all, irrespective of gender and education.

Although most neighborhood research measures disadvantage at the census tract level, more proximate physical characteristics of neighborhoods may be more relevant indicators of neighborhood quality for the well-being of young children. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this study explores the association between these more proximate indicators of neighborhood physical disorder measured across childhood (ages 3 to 9) and early delinquency at age 9. Descriptive results (N=2,989) indicate that exposure to neighborhood physical disorder across childhood is common among children in urban areas.

After including proxies for other CEO attributes including experience, education and formant position, we document economically significant voice pitch effects.

Average EEG activity preceding key presses was substantially different when participants had to monitor the clock than when they did not. Smaller clock-related differences in average EEG activity were also present preceding tone onsets.

This research provides a novel answer to this question: consumers' subjective perceptions of goal conflict. The authors show that beyond the number of goals competing for consumers' time, perceived conflict between goals makes them feel that they have less time. Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as well as how much they are willing to pay to save time. The authors identify two simple interventions that can help consumers mitigate goal conflict's negative effects: slow breathing and anxiety reappraisal. Together, the findings shed light on the factors that drive how consumers perceive, spend, and value their time.","[Etkin, Jordan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Evangelidis, Ioannis] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Mkt Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Aaker, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Mkt, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Etkin, J (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",jordan.etkin@duke.edu; ievangelidis@rsm.nl; jaaker@stanford.edu,,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,2015,52,3,10.1509/jmr.14.0130,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000357872400008,394-406,Etkin,Jordan,15-Jun,Etkin_JournMarketRes_2015_q68mk.pdf,perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained,perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained,0,1,1178,(x1: 211.00 y1: 167.99) (x2: 262.70 y2: 187.01),Perceiving more conflict between goals makes consumers feel pressed for time,Perceiving more conflict between goals makes consumers feel pressed for time,0,2,4240,(x1: 342.85 y1: 280.37) (x2: 417.15 y2: 298.68),"As we predicted, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on subjective time perceptions showed that per- ceiving more conflict between goals made people feel more pressed for time (F(3, 119) = 4.42, p < .05, hp 2 = .100; Figure 2)","As we predicted, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on subjective time perceptions showed that perceiving more conflict between goals made people feel more pressed for time [F(3,119)=4.42, p<.05, partial eta-squared = .100]",0,4,1407,(x1: 64.00 y1: 346.69) (x2: 62.33 y2: 400.42),"(F(3, 119) = 4.42, p < .05, hp 2 = .100","F(3,119)=4.42, p<.05, partial eta-squared = .100",4,1586,(x1: 120.36 y1: 380.61) (x2: 262.80 y2: 389.12),Jordan Etkin,jordan.etkin@duke.edu,1,v684b

We describe a surprising developmental pattern: Younger learners are better than older ones at inferring abstract causal relations. Walker and Gopnik (2014) demonstrated that toddlers are able to infer that an effect was caused by a relation between two objects (whether they are the same or different), rather than by individual kinds of objects. While these findings are consistent with evidence that infants recognize same-different relations, they contrast with a large literature suggesting that older children tend to have difficulty inferring these relations. Why might this be? In Experiment 1a, we demonstrate that while younger children (18-30-month-olds) have no difficulty learning these relational concepts, older children (36-48-month-olds) fail to draw this abstract inference. Experiment 1b replicates the finding with 18-30-month-olds using a more demanding intervention task. Experiment 2 tests whether this difference in performance might be because older children have developed the general hypothesis that individual kinds of objects are causal - the high initial probability of this alternative hypothesis might override the data that favors the relational hypothesis. Providing additional information falsifying the alternative hypothesis improves older children's performance. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrates that prompting for explanations during learning also improves performance, even without any additional information. These findings are discussed in light of recent computational and algorithmic theories of learning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the reverse regularly occurs under systematic conditions. In six studies, we examine how observers perceive both organizations and individuals who make a mistake and correct it, versus those who actively prevent that same mistake from occurring in the first place. We find that observers infer that others who make and correct a mistake while pursuing a goal are more likely to achieve that goal than others who successfully prevent that same mistake from occurring. We further find that observers make this inference because, although observers construe prevention to mean that a goal pursuer has been consistently vigilant, they believe mistake correction requires more effort than prevention (even when it does not). Moreover, the effort signaled by correction is perceived as more diagnostic of goal commitment than the vigilance signaled by prevention. Consequently, observers judge both individuals and organizations that make and then correct a mistake to be more likely to achieve the goal imperiled by the mistake than an otherwise identical entity that actively prevented the same mistake from occurring in the first place. We further find that these benefits of mistake correction occur only when a mistake is attributed to an unstable cause. As a result, these benefits of mistake correction do not emerge in all contexts for example, observers attribute a mistake to a stable cause when it is repeated or has very large consequences, and this stable attribution prevents the benefits of correction from emerging.","[Kupor, Daniella] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Reich, Taly] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Management, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Laurin, Kristin] Univ British Columbia, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Kupor, D (reprint author), Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dkupor@bu.edu; taly.reich@yale.edu; klaurin@psych.ubc.ca,,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0749-5978,1095-9920,2018,149,,10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.08.002,"Psychology, Applied; Management; Psychology, Social",Psychology; Business & Economics,WOS:000452815800011,165-178,Kupor,Daniella,18-Nov,Kupor_OrgBehavior_2018_xpbyb.pdf,"We further find that observers make this inference because, although observers construe prevention to mean that a goal pursuer has been consistently vigilant, they believe mistake correction requires more effort than prevention (even when it does not).","We further find that observers make this inference because, although observers construe prevention to mean that a goal pursuer has been consistently vigilant, they believe mistake correction requires more effort than prevention (even when it does not).",0,1,1360,(x1: 462.27 y1: 343.05) (x2: 218.25 y2: 376.55),"First, we predict that people perceive that correcting (vs. preventing) a mistake requires more effort (i.e., a greater perceived expenditure of energy; Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981).","First, we predict that people perceive that correcting (vs. preventing) a mistake requires more effort (i.e., a greater perceived expenditure of energy; Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981).",0,2,7752,(x1: 405.18 y1: 624.62) (x2: 557.67 y2: 650.89),"Consistent with our predictions, participants who read that Efficient Corp corrected (vs. prevented) a mistake perceived that its actions | required more effort (MPrevention: 5.83, SDPrevention: 1.99; MCorrection: 6.38, SDCorrection: 1.87; t(198) = 2.02, p = .045; Cohen’s d = .286; 95% CI: .020 to .553),","Consistent with our predictions, participants who read that Efficient Corp corrected (vs. prevented) a mistake perceived that its actions...required more effort (M_Prevention: 5.83, SD_Prevention: 1.99; M_Correction: 6.38, SD_Correction: 1.87; t(198) = 2.02, p = .045; Cohen’s d = .286; 95% CI: .020 to .553)...",0,6 | 6,2709 | 3028,(x1: 50.06 y1: 676.95) (x2: 268.58 y2: 692.78) | (x1: 155.05 y1: 718.79) (x2: 214.70 y2: 745.06),"t(198) = 2.02, p = .045; Cohen’s d = .286; 95% CI: .020 to .553","t(198) = 2.02, p = .045; Cohen’s d = .286; 95% CI: .020 to .553",6,3128,(x1: 237.77 y1: 729.28) (x2: 209.47 y2: 745.06),na,na,1,p4zyz

In two experiments, we show that task switching can enhance two principal forms of creativity divergent thinking (Study 1) and convergent thinking (Study 2) in part because temporarily setting a task aside reduces cognitive fixation. Participants who continually alternated back and forth between two creativity tasks outperformed both participants who switched between the tasks at their discretion and participants who attempted one task for the first half of the allotted time before switching to the other task for the second half. Importantly, Studies 3a-3d reveal that people overwhelmingly fail to adopt a continual-Switch approach when incentivized to choose a task switching strategy that would maximize their creative performance.

We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the clear net benefits for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately a month's earnings, conditional on demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. The results suggest that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.","[Atkin, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Lahore Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Atkin, D (reprint author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,2017,132,3,10.1093/qje/qjx010,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000406177000002,1101-1164,Atkin,David,17-Aug,Atkin_QuartJournEco_2017_048vl.pdf,"This article studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. | incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption.","This article studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. | incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption.",0,1 | 2,179 | 170,(x1: 93.67 y1: 193.28) (x2: 153.25 y2: 210.07) | (x1: 260.08 y1: 96.14) (x2: 353.19 y2: 112.94),"a mis- alignment of incentives within the firm is an important reason for the lack of adoption. | A simple modification to the labor contract, conditioning the wage contract on marginal cost, | an ex post–revealed characteristic of the technology, induces the agent to encourage adoption of the technology and the principal to adopt it.","a mis- alignment of incentives within the firm is an important reason for the lack of adoption. | A simple modification to the labor contract, conditioning the wage contract on marginal cost, | an ex post–revealed characteristic of the technology, induces the agent to encourage adoption of the technology and the principal to adopt it.",0,4 | 4 | 5,1056 | 2029 | 52,(x1: 323.46 y1: 275.12) (x2: 147.09 y2: 305.08) | (x1: 226.48 y1: 454.45) (x2: 353.18 y2: 472.45) | (x1: 77.73 y1: 82.98) (x2: 127.75 y2: 112.94),"Table VIII uses the liberal adoption measure to assess for- mally the impact of the incentive payment intervention on adop- tion rates. | Panel A reports impacts on adoption in the short run | The dependent variable in columns (2)–(4) is a binary indicator for whether a firm has adopted. | The reduced-form (intent-to-treat, ITT) result in column (3) does not suffer from such selection issues and indicates a positive and significant (at the 5% level) causal relationship be- tween assignment and adoption.

Drawing on data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, the author uses a series of individual fixed-effects models to investigate whether particular types of relationship transitions over children's first decade of life are associated with increased risk for maternal and paternal child abuse and maternal neglect. Findings question and confirm a number of long-standing theoretical and empirical findings from the child maltreatment literature. Results indicate that transitions to being single are associated with increased risk for maternal child abuse and neglect. In addition, the frequency and severity of paternal harsh parenting may be closely linked with the nature of fathers' relationship transitions.

The purpose of this article is to ascertain how both the socioeconomic attributes and the location characteristics of one-person households at the time of their formation affect the durations of these households under the rapidly changing Korean demography. The spatial distribution of the areal location quotient indexes for one-person households indicated that the concentration of these households is relatively higher in the inner cities of metropolitan areas and the outskirts of the Seoul metropolitan region. Meanwhile, the distribution patterns of the relative concentration levels for one-person households by age group exhibited obvious differences. In the survival analysis for the entire sample of this research, household attributes were the primary determinants. However, the results of the empirical analyses by age group indicated that location characteristics were significant as well, although the significance of the variables varied with the types of one-person households. The duration of households of one person under 40 years old was affected by their access to employment districts and the concentration level of one-person households in the area. In contrast, the duration of households of one person 65 years old and older was influenced by the distribution of affordable housing.

This study considers both patterns; it examines selectivity separately in low- and high-prevalence communities and for first-time and repeat migrants. Based on data from 18,042 household heads in 119 Mexican communities from the Mexican Migration Project, the analyses show that (1) first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities come from poor households, whereas repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households; and (2) higher amounts of remittances reach wealthy households. These results suggest that repeat migration and remittances may be mechanisms for wealth accumulation in the study communities. Descriptive analyses associate these mechanisms with increasing wealth disparities between households with and without migrants, especially in high-prevalence communities. The study, similar to prior findings, shows the importance of repeat migration trips, which, given sustained remittances, may amplify the wealth gap between migrants and nonmigrants in migrant-sending communities. The study also qualifies prior findings by differentiating between low- and high-prevalence communities and observing a growing wealth gap only in the latter.","Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Garip, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",fgarip@wjh.harvard.edu,,SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0070-3370,1533-7790,2012,49,4,10.1007/s13524-012-0128-6,Demography,Demography,WOS:000310954300008,1335-1360,Garip,Filiz,12-Nov,Garip_Demography_2012_v53kk.pdf,"Based on data from 18,042 household heads in 119 Mexican communities from the Mexican Migration Project, the analyses show that (1) first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities come from poor households, whereas repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households","Based on data from 18,042 household heads in 119 Mexican communities from the Mexican Migration Project, the analyses show that (1) first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities come from poor households, whereas repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households",0,1,612,(x1: 308.69 y1: 294.79) (x2: 170.59 y2: 347.98),"Investigating both patterns, we found that first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities originate from poor households (with an average $3,305 in land and 2.1 rooms in properties), and repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households (with an average $11,124 in land and 3.2 rooms in properties).","Investigating both patterns, we found that first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities originate from poor households (with an average $3,305 in land and 2.1 rooms in properties), and repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households (with an average $11,124 in land and 3.2 rooms in properties).",0,20,1014,(x1: 253.46 y1: 215.65) (x2: 268.33 y2: 268.83),"Table 4 reports the estimated marginal effects of wealth on the probability of first and repeat migration separately for high- (panel A) and low- (panel B) migration-prevalence communities. | The propensity for repeat migration, by contrast, increases with both land and property ownership but only in communities with high migration prevalence.","Table 4 reports the estimated marginal effects of wealth on the probability of first and repeat migration separately for high- (panel A) and low- (panel B) migration-prevalence communities...The propensity for repeat migration, by contrast, increases with both land and property ownership but only in communities with high migration prevalence.

In this study of emergency department physicians in shift work, schedules induce two distortions: First, physicians slack off by accepting fewer patients near end of shift (EOS). Second, physicians distort patient care, incurring higher costs as they spend less time on patients assigned near EOS. Examining how these effects change with shift overlap reveals a tradeoff between the two. Within an hour after the normal time of work completion, physicians are willing to spend hospital resources more than six times their market wage to preserve their leisure. Accounting for overall costs, I find that physicians slack off at approximately second-best optimal levels.","[Chan, David C.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chan, DC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",david.c.chan@stanford.edu,"NBER Health and Aging Fellowship, under the National Institute of Aging [T32-AG000186]; Charles A.

The Kuba Kingdom, established in Central Africa in the early 17th century by King Shyaam, had more developed state institutions than the other independent villages and chieftaincies in the region. It had an unwritten constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, and significant public goods provision. Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This finding is consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate values in children decline when there is an increase in the effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable behavior. Consistent with such a mechanism, we find that Kuba parents believe it is less important to teach children values related to rule-following behaviors.","[Lowes, Sara] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, MI, Italy; [Nunn, Nathan] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weigel, Jonathan L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lowes, S (reprint author), Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, MI, Italy.",sara.lowes@unibocconi.it; nnunn@fas.harvard.edu; jamesrobinson@uchicago.edu; jweigel@fas.harvard.edu,Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior; National Science Foundation (NSF),WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,2017,85,4,10.3982/ecta14139,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,WOS:000409272900002,1065-1091,Lowes,Sara,17-Jul,Lowes_Econometrica_2017_bv6r9.pdf,We use variation in historical state centralization to examine the long-term impact of institutions on cultural norms. | we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with | a greater propensity to cheat for material gain.,We use variation in historical state centralization to examine the long-term impact of institutions on cultural norms. | we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with | a greater propensity to cheat for material gain.,0,1 | 1 | 1,380 | 970 | 1070,(x1: 105.80 y1: 243.95) (x2: 214.61 y2: 259.04) | (x1: 361.97 y1: 303.58) (x2: 275.60 y2: 318.67) | (x1: 95.85 y1: 323.46) (x2: 268.91 y2: 328.62),Another possibility is that institutions associated with state formation undermine norms of rule following.,Another possibility is that institutions associated with state formation undermine norms of rule following.,0,2,651,(x1: 47.45 y1: 149.37) (x2: 115.88 y2: 167.86),"Table I | panel B reports estimates with the baseline set of control variables. | Columns 4–6 of Table I report estimates using the total amount missing in the three rounds of the UG as the dependent variable.16 Using this second measure, we also find that Kuba descendants are less likely to follow rules.

We pose two research questions. First, what factors influence citizen support for war and military force? We refer to this as the acceptability of war. Second, in addition to the acceptability of war, what other factors affect support for defense spending? Our principal finding is that citizen acceptance of war and support for defense spending are most influenced by basic beliefs and values. Gender also has a strong negative influence on attitudes toward war and thus indirectly lowers support for defense spending among women. Attitudes toward war and defense spending are also sometimes influenced by short-term threats and by alliance considerations, but the effects are not as substantively meaningful.

The attacker's objective is to successfully win at least one battle, while the defender's objective is to win every battle. Theoretically, the defender either folds immediately or, if his valuation is sufficiently high and the number of battles is sufficiently small, then he has a constant incentive to fight in each battle. Attackers respond to defense with diminishing assaults over time. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the authors' experimental results indicate that the probability of successful defense increases in the defenders valuation and it decreases in the overall number of battles in the contest. However, the defender engages in the contest significantly more often than predicted and the aggregate expenditures by both parties exceed predicted levels. Moreover, both defenders and attackers actually increase the intensity of the fight as they approach the end of the contest.","[Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Deck, Cary] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA USA","Deck, C (reprint author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, 402 WCOB, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",cdeck@walton.uark.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0027,1552-8766,2012,56,6,10.1177/0022002712438355,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000310734400005,1069-1088,Deck,Cary,12-Dec,Deck_JournConflictRes_2012_n0823.pdf,"Consistent with theoretical predictions, the authors’ experimental results indi- cate that the probability of successful defense increases in the defenders valuation","Consistent with theoretical predictions, the authors’ experimental results indi- cate that the probability of successful defense increases in the defenders valuation",0,1,619,(x1: 48.64 y1: 345.83) (x2: 383.33 y2: 362.72),"Result 1: Consistent with theoretical predictions, the probability of successful defense increases in the defender’s valuation.","Result 1: Consistent with theoretical predictions, the probability of successful defense increases in the defender’s valuation.",0,10,1887,(x1: 58.56 y1: 433.84) (x2: 254.55 y2: 450.31),"Specifically, consistent with theoretical pre- dictions, the probability of successful defense is higher in the N3-V150 treatment than in the N3-V100 treatment.

However, this correlation is not sufficient evidence of causation due to a number of analytical biases. To address this problem, data were collected through a panel study conducted on students who were randomly assigned to dormitories during their first year of college. In addition, the data were preprocessed before analysis with a matching procedure. These data show that discussing politics and current events caused these students to participate in civic activities during their first year of college. A follow-up study conducted on the same population during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years. Further analysis shows that the boost in civic participation initially after engaging in civic talk is the mechanism by which the effect of civic talk lasts into the future.","Univ Miami, Dept Polit Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA","Klofstad, CA (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Polit Sci, 5250 Univ Dr,Jenkins Bldg,Room 314-G, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,2010,88,5,10.1353/sof.2010.0047,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000281058700016,2353-2375,Klofstad,Casey A.,10-Jul,Klofstad_SocialForces_2010_8g04y.pdf,A follow-up study conducted on the same popula- tion during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years.,A follow-up study conducted on the same popula- tion during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years.,0,1,783,(x1: 164.91 y1: 201.26) (x2: 342.17 y2: 231.40),The evidence shows that subjects were still more likely to participate in voluntary civic organiza- tions three years after they engaged in discussions of politics and current events.,The evidence shows that subjects were still more likely to participate in voluntary civic organiza- tions three years after they engaged in discussions of politics and current events.,0,13,370,(x1: 286.12 y1: 90.52) (x2: 368.80 y2: 122.20),"Similar results appear in the second column.

Firms with higher debt concentration at the start of the case are more likely to file prearranged bankruptcy plans, to move quickly through the restructuring process, and to emerge successfully as independent going concerns. Moreover, higher ownership concentration within a debt class is associated with higher recovery rates to that class.

We test the impact of the tsunami shock on generosity of a sample of Sri Lankan affected/unaffected microfinance borrowers seven years after the event. Specifically, we test the effect of the shock at the extensive margin by comparing damaged with non-damaged individuals in terms of giving and expected giving in a dictator game. Moreover, at the intensive margin, we compare the participants based on the amount of damage experienced and recovery aid received. The advantage of this last comparison is that differences in observables between the groups are minimized. We reduce further identification problems by selecting a random sample of damaged and non-damaged borrowers belonging to the same microfinance organization who are, therefore, likely to share some important common traits that are usually unobservable to researchers. We complete our identification strategy with weighted least squares, instrumental variable estimates and a sensitivity analysis on the exogeneity assumption. The main findings of the paper support the hypothesis that the shock affects participants' preferences in the long run. First, the tsunami negatively affects generosity at the extensive margin as those who suffered at least one damage give and expect less than those who did not. Second, while large recovery assistance does not directly affect giving and expected giving, it increases especially the latter indirectly, i.e., when interacted with the number of damages. Our results reconcile that part of the literature showing evidence of natural shocks having a detrimental effect on social preferences (Fleming, Chong, Alberto, & Bejarano, 2011; Cassar, Grosjean, & Whitt, 2013) with that supporting, instead, a positive link (Solnit, 2009; Whitt & Wilson, 2007; Cassar, Healy, & Von Kessler, 2011).

Selfies are a form of self-expression; but selfie-taking also shapes the selfie-taker's self. We argue that taking selfies in a place strengthens selfie-takers' identification with that place. In three experimental studies (two-group post-test comparison design), the control group took pictures of a place (Studies 1 & 2: university; Study 3: city), whereas the experimental group took selfies in that place. Place identification was higher in the selfie condition than in the control condition (Study 1). Task enjoyment moderated the effect of taking selfies on place identification (Studies 2 & 3). However, not all sub-dimensions (i.e., affective, cognitive, and conative) of place identification were equally affected by the selfie-task across contexts. Our results suggest that taking selfies in a place can strengthen the linkage between selfie-takers and places. The effect can reverse for individuals who do not enjoy taking selfies.","[Stiglbauer, Barbara] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Educ & Psychol, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Weber, Silvana] Julius Maximilian Univ Wurzburg, Fac Human Sci, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Stiglbauer, B (reprint author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Educ & Psychol, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",barbara.stiglbauer@jku.at; silvana.weber@uni-wuerzburg.de,,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-4944,1522-9610,2018,58,,10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.07.007,"Environmental Studies; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Psychology,WOS:000445717900003,18-26,Stiglbauer,Barbara,18-Aug,Stiglbauer_JournEnvPsych_2018_ol325.pdf,Place identification was higher in the selfie condition than in the control condition (Study 1).,Place identification was higher in the selfie condition than in the control condition (Study 1).,0,1,1125,(x1: 269.18 y1: 325.28) (x2: 211.85 y2: 339.31),"as selfie- taking is a self-defining activity happening in a specific place, selfie- taking should increase identification with the respective place.","as selfie- taking is a self-defining activity happening in a specific place, selfie- taking should increase identification with the respective place.",0,3,284,(x1: 257.78 y1: 91.55) (x2: 261.18 y2: 117.42),the hypothesis test revealed a significant multivariate main eﬀect of experimental condition on place identification. | see Table 1,"...the hypothesis test revealed a significant multivariate main eﬀect of experimental condition on place identification...see Table 1...[Table 1, Multivariate model, Study 1, Experimental condition: F = 2.88, p = .039, f-squared = .08]",0,4 | 4,2106 | 2404,(x1: 80.34 y1: 434.08) (x2: 234.67 y2: 449.52) | (x1: 153.73 y1: 475.92) (x2: 194.17 y2: 480.87),Table 1 | Multivariate model | F | p | f2 | Study 1 | Experimental condition | 2.88 | .039 | .08,"Table 1, Multivariate model, Study 1, Experimental condition: F = 2.88, p = .039, f-squared = .08",4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4,5434,(x1: 37.59 y1: 528.70) (x2: 62.99 y2: 533.20) | (x1: 179.04 y1: 562.63) (x2: 233.43 y2: 566.59) | (x1: 179.04 y1: 596.49) (x2: 182.32 y2: 600.43) | (x1: 211.81 y1: 596.49) (x2: 214.96 y2: 600.43) | (x1: 244.52 y1: 596.49) (x2: 249.30 y2: 597.60) | (x1: 43.60 y1: 612.98) (x2: 65.38 y2: 616.94) | (x1: 49.95 y1: 647.27) (x2: 116.36 y2: 651.23) | (x1: 179.04 y1: 647.27) (x2: 191.57 y2: 651.23) | (x1: 211.81 y1: 647.27) (x2: 224.33 y2: 651.23) | (x1: 244.52 y1: 647.27) (x2: 253.46 y2: 651.23),Barbara Stiglbauer,barbara.stiglbauer@jku.at,1,kl5db

The kin selection hypothesis for male androphilia suggests that androphilic males have been selected to act as ""helpers-in-the-nest,"" caring for nieces and nephews and, by extension, increasing their indirect fitness. Previous research has demonstrated that Samoan male androphiles (known locally as fa'afafine) exhibit significantly higher altruistic tendencies toward nieces and nephews compared to Samoan women and gynephilic men. Elevated avuncular tendencies must translate into real-world avuncular behavior if they are to have any impact on the fitness of nieces and nephews and the uncles themselves. The present study examined whether Samoan fa'afafine exhibit higher altruistic behavior toward nieces and nephews compared to women and gynephilic men. We used money given to, and received from, oldest and youngest siblings' sons and daughters as a behavioral assay of kin altruism. Compared to women and gynephilic men, fa'afafine gave significantly more money to their youngest siblings' daughters. No group differences were observed for money received from nieces and/or nephews. There were no correlations between number of children parented and monetary exchanges with the niece and nephew categories examined, suggesting that childlessness cannot account for why fa'afafine give more money to their youngest siblings' daughters. These findings are consistent with the kin selection hypothesis for male androphilia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, there have been surprisingly few empirical validation studies of these indirect techniques because the information required to verify the resulting estimates is often difficult to access. This article reports findings from the first comprehensive validation study of indirect methods.

We then find that, as hypothesized, ego depletion is associated with decreased unethical behavior of high social consensus (Studies 1 and 2). Results further suggest that, controlling for state self-control resources, depleted participants are less likely to engage in unethical behavior of high social consensus as a result of increased subjective fatigue (Study 3).

However, selection looms large in this line of research, and it has been argued that estimates of neighborhood effects are biased because people nonrandomly select into neighborhoods based on their preferences, income, and the availability of alternative housing. We propose a two-step framework to disentangle selection processes in the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and earnings. We model neighborhood selection using a conditional logit model, from which we derive correction terms. Driven by the recognition that most households prefer certain types of neighborhoods rather than specific areas, we employ a principle components analysis to reduce these terms into eight correction components. We use these to adjust parameter estimates from a model of subsequent neighborhood effects on individual income for the unequal probability that a household chooses to live in a particular type of neighborhood. We apply this technique to administrative data from the Netherlands. After we adjust for the differential sorting of households into certain types of neighborhoods, the effect of neighborhood income on individual income diminishes but remains significant. These results further emphasize that researchers need to be attuned to the role of selection bias when assessing the role of neighborhood effects on individual outcomes. Perhaps more importantly, the persistent effect of neighborhood deprivation on subsequent earnings suggests that neighborhood effects reflect more than the shared characteristics of neighborhood residents: place of residence partially determines economic well-being.","[van Ham, Maarten; Vogel, Matt] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, OTB Res Built Environm, POB 5043, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [van Ham, Maarten] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Boschman, Sanne] Univ Utrecht, Social & Behav Sci, Padualaan 14, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vogel, Matt] Univ Missouri St Louis, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, St Louis, MO USA","van Ham, M (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, OTB Res Built Environm, POB 5043, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.; van Ham, M (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",m.vanham@tudelft.nl,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP)/ERC Grant Agreement [615159]; Marie Curie programme under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP)/Career Integration [PCIG10-GA-2011-303728],SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0070-3370,1533-7790,2018,55,3,10.1007/s13524-018-0672-9,Demography,Demography,WOS:000434755300012,1069-1090,van Ham,Maarten,18-Jun,van Ham_Demography_2018_1nr4z.pdf,"After we adjust for the differential sorting of households into certain types of neigh- borhoods, the effect of neighborhood income on individual income diminishes but remains significant.","After we adjust for the differential sorting of households into certain types of neigh- borhoods, the effect of neighborhood income on individual income diminishes but remains significant.",0,1,1371,(x1: 51.02 y1: 406.74) (x2: 127.04 y2: 436.06),"The conclusion from our models is that controlling for neighborhood selection leads to less biased estimates of neighborhood effects.

How does rule of law take hold in an economy? The author uses an original survey of 516 firms in Russia and Ukraine, as well as interview-based case studies, to reexamine these fundamental issues of political economy. Most states in the developing world lack the requisite time horizons and institutional capacity to make the credible commitments emphasized in the literature. In this context, the author argues that firms can enforce their property rights without resort to mafias by forming alliances with stakeholders such as foreign actors, community residents, and labor. These stakeholders can impose costs on the potential aggressors through diverse political strategies, allowing firms to defend their property rights not only from private predators but also from the state.

The influences of pretrauma internalizing and externalizing problems, prior stressor exposure, and gender were investigated. Additionally, gender was examined as 3 moderator of the associations between internalizing problems and PTSS, externalizing problems and PTSS, and prior stressor exposure and PTSS, Method: Participants were 157 children and adolescents (75% male; age M = 13.30 years, SD = 3.60; 44% Caucasian, 39% African American, 13% Hispanic, and 4% other) admitted to 2 hospitals for physical injuries. Youths and their parents completed measures of PTSS (Child Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index), internalizing and externalizing problems (Child Behavior Checklist), and prior stressor exposure (Coddington Life Events Scale, Child) during the hospital stay; youths completed up to 3 additional PTSS assessments targeted at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed a significant average decline in PTSS over time (p < .05) that followed a curvilinear trajectory. Externalizing problems, prior stressor exposure, and female gender predicted higher initial PTSS levels (p < .05). Gender moderated the influence of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and prior stressor exposure on decline in PTSS over time (p < .05). Patterns of recovery for those with high and low levels of each characteristic differed for girls and boys.

Do People Contrast and Assimilate Candidate Ideology?

This paper pins down one of these causal directions.

The current research analyzes reasoning about three kinds of beliefs: those that concern matters of fact (e.g., dinosaurs are extinct), preference (e.g., green is the prettiest color), and ideology (e.g., there is only one God). The domain of ideology is of unique interest because it is hypothesized to contain elements of both facts and preferences. If adults' distinct reasoning about ideological beliefs is the result of prolonged experience with the physical and social world, children and adults should reveal distinct patterns of differentiating kinds of beliefs, and this difference should be particularly pronounced with respect to ideological beliefs. On the other hand, if adults' reasoning about beliefs is a basic component of social cognition, children and adults should demonstrate similar belief representations and patterns of belief differentiation. Two experiments demonstrate that 5-10 year old children and adults similarly judged religious beliefs to be intermediate between factual beliefs (where two disagreeing people cannot both be right) and preferences (where they can). From the age of 5 years and continuing into adulthood, individuals distinguished ideological beliefs from other types of mental states and demonstrated limited tolerance for belief-based disagreements.

Although nonnative accent is a complex signal, its effects on assessments of the speakers' political skill are something that speakers can actively mitigate; this makes it an important bias to understand. In Study 1, White and Asian nonnative speakers using the same scripted responses as native speakers were found to be significantly less likely to be recommended for a middle-management position, and this bias was fully mediated by assessments of their political skill. The alternative explanations of race, communication skill, and collaborative skill were nonsignificant. In Study 2, entrepreneurial start-up pitches from national high-technology, new-venture funding competitions were shown to experienced executive MBA students. Nonnative speakers were found to have a significantly lower likelihood of receiving new-venture funding, and this was fully mediated by the coders' assessments of their political skill.

We developed a mathematical model and followed a hierarchical Bayesian estimation approach to test to what extent a reduction in cognitive capacities leads to a shift in preference or an increase in choice inconsistency. Using a within-subject n-back task to manipulate cognitive load, we conducted three experiments across different choice domains: risky choice, temporal discounting, and strategic interaction. Across all three domains, results show that a reduction in cognitive capacities predominantly affected participants' level of choice consistency rather than their respective preference. These results hold on an individual and a group level. In sum, our approach and the mathematical model we used provide a rigorous and general test of how reduced cognitive capacities affect people's decision-making.","[Olschewski, Sebastian; Rieskamp, Joerg] Univ Basel, Ctr Econ Psychol, Dept Psychol, Missionsstr 62a, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland; [Scheibehenne, Benjamin] Univ Geneva, Sch Econ & Management GSEM, Geneva, Switzerland","Olschewski, S (reprint author), Univ Basel, Ctr Econ Psychol, Dept Psychol, Missionsstr 62a, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland.",sebastian.olschewski@unibas.ch,[SNF: 100014_149846],AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,2018,147,4,10.1037/xge0000403,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,WOS:000430930200002,462-484,Olschewski,Sebastian,18-Apr,Olschewski_JournExPsychGen_2018_qnzkm.pdf,results show that a reduction in cognitive capacities predominantly affected participants’ level of choice consistency,results show that a reduction in cognitive capacities predominantly affected participants’ level of choice consistency,0,1,998,(x1: 333.91 y1: 274.54) (x2: 373.83 y2: 289.00),A reduction in cognitive capacities might lead to an increase in choice inconsistencies,A reduction in cognitive capacities might lead to an increase in choice inconsistencies,0,1,3000,(x1: 396.33 y1: 462.97) (x2: 464.87 y2: 478.99),As is shown in Table 1 | choice inconsistency increased in the load compared with the control condition,"As is shown in Table 1...choice inconsistency increased in the load compared with the control condition...[Table 1, Linear utility, Probit, Sensitivity: Mean Group Posterior Estimate = -.15, 95% Highest densitity interval (HDI) = [-.24,-.07], significant difference between control and load condition according to the 95% HDI]",0,8 | 8,3734 | 3823,(x1: 425.68 y1: 352.97) (x2: 512.97 y2: 357.99) | (x1: 522.57 y1: 363.97) (x2: 340.00 y2: 390.99),Table 1,"Table 1, Linear utility, Probit, Sensitivity: Mean Group Posterior Estimate = -.15, 95% Highest densitity interval (HDI) = [-.24,-.07], significant difference between control and load condition according to the 95% HDI",8,3749,(x1: 484.82 y1: 352.97) (x2: 512.97 y2: 357.99),Sebastian Olschewski,sebastian.olschewski@unibas.ch,1,kyx49

We employed electroencephalography and the attentional-blink paradigm, in which targets are often unnoticed.

Electrophysiological signatures of early visual processing predicted this behavioral advantage. German speakers (N = 29), who have only one category for light and dark shades of blue, showed no differences in perception between blue and green targets. The behavioral consequence of categorical perception was replicated with Russian speakers (N = 46), reproducing this novel finding.

Sacrificial utilitarian judgments do reflect concern for the greater good: Clarification via process dissociation and the judgments of philosophers,Conway,Paul,2018,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.04.018,0010-0277,Cognition,Cognition,Cognition,FALSE,"Conway, Paul; Goldstein-Greenwood, Jacob; Polacek, David; Greene, Joshua D.",Sacrificial utilitarian judgments do reflect concern for the greater good: Clarification via process dissociation and the judgments of philosophers,COGNITION,English,Moral dilemmas; Dual-processes; Process dissociation; Moral conviction; Trolley dilemmas,MORAL DECISION-MAKING; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DILEMMAS; RESPONSES; CONDEMNATION; PERSONALITY; EXPERTISE; FRAMEWORK; AVERSION; BEHAVIOR,"Researchers have used ""sacrificial"" trolley-type dilemmas (where harmful actions promote the greater good) to model competing influences on moral judgment: affective reactions to causing harm that motivate characteristically deontological judgments (""the ends don't justify the means"") and deliberate cost-benefit reasoning that motivates characteristically utilitarian judgments (""better to save more lives""). Recently, Kahane, Everett, Earp, Farias, and Savulescu (2015) argued that sacrificial judgments reflect antisociality rather than ""genuine utilitarianism,"" but this work employs a different definition of ""utilitarian judgment."" We introduce a five-level taxonomy of ""utilitarian judgment"" and clarify our longstanding usage, according to which judgments are ""utilitarian"" simply because they favor the greater good, regardless of judges' motivations or philosophical commitments. Moreover, we present seven studies revisiting Kahane and colleagues' empirical claims. Studies 1a-1b demonstrate that dilemma judgments indeed relate to utilitarian philosophy, as philosophers identifying as utilitarian/consequentialist were especially likely to endorse utilitarian sacrifices. Studies 2-6 replicate, clarify, and extend Kahane and colleagues' findings using process dissociation to independently assess deontological and utilitarian response tendencies in lay people. Using conventional analyses that treat deontological and utilitarian responses as diametric opposites, we replicate many of Kahane and colleagues' key findings. However, process dissociation reveals that antisociality predicts reduced deontological inclinations, not increased utilitarian inclinations. Critically, we provide evidence that lay people's sacrificial utilitarian judgments also reflect moral concems about minimizing harm. This work clarifies the conceptual and empirical links between moral philosophy and moral psychology and indicates that sacrificial utilitarian judgments reflect genuine moral concern, in both philosophers and ordinary people.","[Conway, Paul; Goldstein-Greenwood, Jacob; Polacek, David] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Conway, Paul] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Greene, Joshua D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Brain Sci, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Conway, P (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",conway@psy.fsu.edu; jrg15b@my.fsu.edu; dap13c@my.fsu.edu; jgreene@wjh.harvard.edu,Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award by the German Research Foundation (DFG) [MU 1500/5-1]; First Year Assistant Professor Award from Florida State University,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0010-0277,1873-7838,2018,179,,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.04.018,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,WOS:000442704800020,241-265,Conway,Paul,18-Oct,Conway_Cognition_2018_jmw4p.pdf,"Studies 1a–1b demonstrate that dilemma judgments indeed relate to utilitarian philosophy, as philosophers identifying as utilitarian/consequentialist were especially likely to endorse utilitarian sacrifices.","Studies 1a–1b demonstrate that dilemma judgments indeed relate to utilitarian philosophy, as philosophers identifying as utilitarian/consequentialist were especially likely to endorse utilitarian sacrifices.",0,1,1820,(x1: 534.78 y1: 372.10) (x2: 482.76 y2: 395.66),We predicted that the judgments of philosophers will reveal a robust relationship between the endorsement of utilitarian/consequentialist philosophy and sacrificial utilitarian judgments.,We predicted that the judgments of philosophers will reveal a robust relationship between the endorsement of utilitarian/consequentialist philosophy and sacrificial utilitarian judgments.,0,5,629,(x1: 37.59 y1: 449.22) (x2: 213.29 y2: 475.09),"the degree to which philosophers accepted turning the trolley (thereby killing one to save five) correlated robustly with en- dorsement of consequentialist normative ethics, r(753) = .29, p < .001","...the degree to which philosophers accepted turning the trolley (thereby killing one to save five) correlated robustly with endorsement of consequentialist normative ethics, r(753) = .29, p < .001",0,6,6014,(x1: 367.08 y1: 394.91) (x2: 340.46 y2: 431.27),"r(753) = .29, p < .001","r(753) = .29, p < .001",6,6188,(x1: 510.69 y1: 415.84) (x2: 340.46 y2: 431.27),Paul Conway,conway@psy.fsu.edu,1,k84bz

A major issue is to know which one of these two representations is preferentially activated when people intend to use a tool. To address this issue, we developed a paradigm in which, in 20% of trials, participants had to press a button and actually use pliers to move an object in response to a predefined target symbol. Importantly, two masks hiding the symbols performed ""opening"" or ""closing"" actions before symbols appeared. In Experiment 1, participants used normal pliers: Hand's opening actions induced pliers' opening actions and vice versa for hands' closing actions. Results indicated a compatibility effect between masks' actions and pliers' actions. Participants were faster to press the button in response to the target symbol when opening and closing actions of the masks were congruent with the corresponding actions of the hand. In Experiment 2 participants used inverse pliers: Hand's opening actions involved pliers' closing actions and vice versa. In this situation, results showed that the congruency of masks' actions occurred with pliers' actions and not hand's actions. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that intention of use is preferentially based on the representation of tool actions, and have important implications for the domain of neuropsychology of tool use and the theories of goal-directed behavior.

The first point is reached when morphologically unrelated competitors are no longer compatible with the evidence. Adapting terminology from Marslen-Wilson (1984), we refer to this as the word's initial uniqueness point (UP1). The second point is the complex uniqueness point (CUP) introduced by Balling and Baayen (2008), at which morphologically related competitors become incompatible with the input. Later initial as well as complex uniqueness points predict longer response latencies. We argue that the effects of these uniqueness points arise due to the large surprisal (Levy, 2008) carried by the phonemes at these uniqueness points, and provide independent evidence that how cumulative surprisal builds up in the course of the word co-determines response latencies. The presence of effects of surprisal, both at the initial uniqueness point of complex words, and cumulatively throughout the word, challenges the Shortlist B model of Norris and McQueen (2008), and suggests that a Bayesian approach to auditory comprehension requires complementation from information theory in order to do justice to the cognitive cost of updating probability distributions over lexical candidates.

Whereas evaluative generalization between perceptually similar stimuli has been firmly established, the available evidence for symbolic evaluative generalization is less conclusive and limited to one possible type of relation (i.e., similarity). In this paper we offer a new set of procedures that can be used to systematically investigate symbolic evaluative generalization effects. We use these procedures to showcase how evaluative responses towards a focal stimulus can propagate to other stimuli when they are related on the basis of symbolic similarity, opposition, or comparison. These effects were evident when self-report, implicit, approach-avoidance, and behavioral choice measures were employed.

Some participants viewed responsive profiles first whereas others viewed unresponsive profiles first. Results revealed that responsive targets were rated more favorably following exposure to unresponsive targets, regardless of level of attractiveness. Study 2 specifically targeted how contrast effects affect romantic evaluations of a physically unattractive, yet responsive, target.

While researchers have identified a number of situational antecedents to upward counterfactual generation, less is known about individual differences in counterfactual reflection. We address this gap by considering how implicit beliefs regarding the fixedness or malleability of basic characteristics influence counterfactual generation. In a negotiation context, we show that individuals who believe that negotiation ability is changeable are more likely to consider how things could have been better following a negotiation experience compared to individuals who believe that negotiation ability is fixed. We further demonstrate the impact of upward counterfactual reflection on learning and performance: Negotiators who hold malleable beliefs are better able to discover creative agreements that benefit both parties in a negotiation, and these performance differences are mediated by upward counterfactual generation.

In this paper, we answer recent calls to examine ""mixed dyads"" (i.e. negotiators with differing social motives) in addition to homogeneous dyads. Our results showed that cooperative - and mixed - dyads both experienced significantly more positive negotiation processes and outcomes than individualistic dyads. We discuss the important roles communication and reciprocity may have ill helping individualists and cooperators to reach mutually beneficial agreements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the current project was to empirically test the hypothesis that organizational safety climate and transactional supervisor safety leadership would predict the extent to which accidents go unreported by employees. Using hierarchical linear modeling and survey data collected from 1,238 employees in 33 organizations, employee-level supervisor safety enforcement behaviors (and to a less consistent extent, organizational-level safety climate) predicted employee accident underreporting. There was also a significant cross-level interaction, such that the effect of supervisor enforcement on underreporting was attenuated in organizations with a positive safety climate. These results may benefit human resources and safety professionals by pinpointing methods of increasing the accuracy of accident reporting, reducing actual safety incidents, and reducing the costs to individuals and organizations that result from underreporting.","[Probst, Tahira M.] Washington State Univ Vancouver, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA","Probst, TM (reprint author), Washington State Univ Vancouver, Dept Psychol, 14204 Northeast Salmon Creek Ave, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",probst@vancouver.wsu.edu,Society for Human Resources Management Foundation (SHRM) [147],AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0021-9010,1939-1854,2015,100,6,10.1037/a0039195,"Psychology, Applied; Management",Psychology; Business & Economics,WOS:000364588900014,1899-1907,Probst,Tahira M.,15-Nov,Probst_JournAppPsych_2015_q4270.pdf,"Using hierarchical linear modeling and survey data collected from 1,238 employees in 33 organizations, employee-level supervisor safety enforcement behaviors (and to a less consistent extent, organizational- level safety climate) predicted employee accident underreporting.","Using hierarchical linear modeling and survey data collected from 1,238 employees in 33 organizations, employee-level supervisor safety enforcement behaviors (and to a less consistent extent, organizational- level safety climate) predicted employee accident underreporting.",0,1,621,(x1: 129.00 y1: 256.54) (x2: 338.01 y2: 281.00),Hypothesis 2: Employees who perceive low supervisor en- forcement of safety policies will engage in greater underre- porting than employees who perceive stronger supervisor en- forcement of safety policies.,Hypothesis 2: Employees who perceive low supervisor en- forcement of safety policies will engage in greater underre- porting than employees who perceive stronger supervisor en- forcement of safety policies.,0,3,2770,(x1: 64.00 y1: 576.04) (x2: 168.71 y2: 614.26),"Model 1 | included individual-level supervisor enforcement and the number of reported accidents as a control variable | in Table 3 | In support of Hypothesis 2, greater supervisor enforcement was related to significantly fewer unreported accidents, t(31)   3.72, p  .001",n | a,0,5 | 5 | 5 | 5,710 | 725 | 1134 | 1404,(x1: 48.00 y1: 383.57) (x2: 78.89 y2: 388.59) | (x1: 108.91 y1: 383.57) (x2: 259.71 y2: 399.68) | (x1: 188.19 y1: 450.07) (x2: 226.17 y2: 455.09) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 505.47) (x2: 80.72 y2: 532.65),"t(31)   3.72, p  .001 | Table 3 | Multilevel Estimate | Model 1 | Level 1 | Supervisor enforcement | 0.040 (0.011) | Standard errors are in parentheses. | p  .001","Table 3, Model 1, Level 1, Supervisor enforcement, Multilevel Estimate = -0.40, Standard error = 0.011, t(31)=-3.72, p < .001",5 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6,1520,(x1: 233.09 y1: 516.62) (x2: 80.72 y2: 532.65) | (x1: 117.00 y1: 77.98) (x2: 144.99 y2: 83.00) | (x1: 117.00 y1: 89.05) (x2: 187.99 y2: 94.00) | (x1: 281.87 y1: 108.54) (x2: 309.42 y2: 113.00) | (x1: 117.00 y1: 134.04) (x2: 141.88 y2: 138.50) | (x1: 125.00 y1: 152.04) (x2: 202.31 y2: 156.50) | (x1: 272.81 y1: 152.04) (x2: 316.14 y2: 156.50) | (x1: 142.11 y1: 293.04) (x2: 255.17 y2: 297.50) | (x1: 212.98 y1: 311.10) (x2: 242.96 y2: 315.50),Tahira M.

In experiment 1, children (N = 284) indicated that a character owns the land more and has more ownership right than another character when arriving first compared with arriving at the same time. In the second experiment (N = 551) it was found that first arrivers who work the land are perceived to own the land more than those who do not work the land. Yet, the importance of investment for inferring ownership was not so strong to fully undermine the first arriver principle. Additionally, when the first arriving character intended to abandon the land she was considered to own the land less than when she had the intention to return. However, information about abandonment intention also was not relevant enough to fully undermine the possessory right of the first arriver. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study has confirmed that the composition of landscape photographs according to the Golden Section, or the Rule of Thirds, and the position of the horizon in the photograph significantly influence the perceived beauty of the depicted landscape scenes. Moreover, we have found that placing positively perceived landscape elements at the intersection points of a grid based on the Rule of Thirds significantly increases positive evaluations of entire landscape scenes, while placing negatively perceived landscape elements according to the same rules makes negative evaluations more negative. Our finding about negative evaluations is innovative: this phenomenon has not been demonstrated by previous research.

We propose that these diverging romantic outcomes of narcissism can be explained by differential associations with agentic versus antagonistic dimensions of grandiose narcissism: Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry. Both dimensions serve the central narcissistic goal of gaining and maintaining a grandiose self-view, but do so by different processes: Admiration is characterized by the tendency to promote the positivity of one's self-view by seeking social admiration (assertive self-enhancement). Rivalry is characterized by the tendency to protect oneself from a negative self-view by derogating others (antagonistic self-protection). Across 7 studies (total N = 3,560) using diverse measures and methodological approaches (self-, peer, and partner reports, as well as interpersonal perception measures in video-based studies, face-to-face laboratory encounters, and online surveys), we show that the short-term romantic appeal associated with narcissism is primarily attributable to the dimension of Admiration, whereas the long-term romantic problems associated with narcissism are primarily attributable to the dimension of Rivalry. These results highlight the utility of a 2-dimensional reconceptualization of grandiose narcissism for explaining its heterogeneous romantic outcomes. The findings further underscore the idea that different facets of personality traits might impact different aspects of romantic relationship quality, depending on the stage of the relationship.

Traditionally, optimism has been characterized as a resource that encourages positive coping efforts within relationships. Yet, some work suggests optimism can be a liability, as expecting the best may prevent individuals from taking proactive steps when confronted with difficulties. To reconcile these perspectives, the current article argues that greater attention must be given to the way in which optimistic expectancies are conceptualized. Whereas generalized dispositional optimism may predict constructive responses to relationship difficulties, more focused relationship-specific forms of optimism may predict poor coping responses. A multi-method, longitudinal study of newly married couples confirmed that spouses higher in dispositional optimism (a) reported engaging in more positive problem-solving behaviors on days in which they experienced greater relationship conflict, (b) were observed to display more constructive problem-solving behaviors when discussing important marital issues with their partner in the lab, and (c) experienced fewer declines in marital well-being over the 1st year of marriage. Conversely, spouses higher in relationship-specific optimism (a) reported engaging in fewer constructive problem-solving behaviors on high conflict days, (b) were observed to exhibit worse problem-solving behaviors in the lab-particularly when discussing marital issues of greater importance-and (c) experienced steeper declines in marital well-being over time. All findings held controlling for self-esteem and neuroticism. Together, results suggest that whereas global forms of optimism may represent a relationship asset, specific forms of optimism can place couples at risk for marital deterioration.","[Neff, Lisa A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Geers, Andrew L.] Univ Toledo, Dept Psychol, Toledo, OH USA","Neff, LA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, 108 East Dean Keaton St,Stop A2702, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",lneff@austin.utexas.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2013,105,1,10.1037/a0032600,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000320909900003,38-60,Neff,Lisa A.,13-Jul,Neff_JournPerSocPsy_2013_q23md.pdf,"A multi-method, longitudinal study of newly married couples confirmed that spouses higher in dispositional optimism (a) reported engaging in more positive problem-solving behaviors on days in which they experienced greater relationship conflict","A multi-method, longitudinal study of newly married couples confirmed that spouses higher in dispositional optimism (a) reported engaging in more positive problem-solving behaviors on days in which they experienced greater relationship conflict",0,1,981,(x1: 208.22 y1: 273.04) (x2: 367.64 y2: 297.50),"Specifically, it was predicted that on days when spouses experienced more conflict within the relationship, those higher in global, dispositional optimism would report engaging in more positive problem-solving behaviors, while those higher in situa- tional, relationship-specific optimism would report engaging in less constructive problem-solving behaviors.","Specifically, it was predicted that on days when spouses experienced more conflict within the relationship, those higher in global, dispositional optimism would report engaging in more positive problem-solving behaviors, while those higher in situa- tional, relationship-specific optimism would report engaging in less constructive problem-solving behaviors.",0,8,1948,(x1: 338.64 y1: 140.98) (x2: 468.94 y2: 201.00),Table 3 presents the results of analyses using both self-reports and partner-reports of daily relationship conflict. | optimism predicted the covariance between spouses’ own reports of daily relationship conflict and their problem- solving behaviors in the hypothesized directions,"Table 3 presents the results of analyses using both self-reports and partner-reports of daily relationship conflict…optimism predicted the covariance between spouses’ own reports of daily relationship conflict and their problem- solving behaviors in the hypothesized directions.

Might sound symbolism extend beyond sound-meaning relationships to linkages between sounds and modes of thinking? Integrating sound symbolism with construal level theory, we investigate whether vowel sounds influence the mental level at which people represent and evaluate targets. We propose that back vowels evoke abstract, high-level construal, while front vowels induce concrete, low-level construal. Two initial studies link front vowels to the use of greater visual and conceptual precision, consistent with a construal account. Three subsequent studies explore construal-dependent tradeoffs as a function of vowel sound contained in the target's name. Evaluation of objects named with back vowels was driven by their high-over low-level features; front vowels reduced or reversed this differentiation. Thus, subtle linguistic cues appear capable of influencing the very nature of mental representation.","[Maglio, Sam J.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Management, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Rabaglia, Cristina D.] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Feder, Michael A.] St Johns Univ, Dept Psychol, Queens, NY USA; [Krehm, Madelaine; Trope, Yaacov] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Maglio, SJ (reprint author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Management, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",sam.maglio@utoronto.ca,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,2014,143,3,10.1037/a0035543,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,WOS:000336786300014,1082-1096,Maglio,Sam J.,14-Jun,Maglio_JournExPsychGen_2014_qy82b.pdf,"Two initial studies link front vowels to the use of greater visual and conceptual precision, consistent with a construal account.","Two initial studies link front vowels to the use of greater visual and conceptual precision, consistent with a construal account.",0,1,853,(x1: 387.93 y1: 282.54) (x2: 465.01 y2: 297.00),"Upon asking participants to divide the city into as many regions as they saw fit, we hypothesized that those perceiving a city named with a front (vs. back) vowel would create more distinct partitions.","Upon asking participants to divide the city into as many regions as they saw fit, we hypothesized that those perceiving a city named with a front (vs. back) vowel would create more distinct partitions.",0,4,5690,(x1: 390.01 y1: 473.98) (x2: 395.16 y2: 512.00),"we conducted a separate analysis to compare front and back vowels that collapsed across the individual city names.

In order to test the possibility that this emotional engagement involves anxiety, we investigated the effects of 1 mg and 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam on the response choices of 40 healthy volunteers (20 male) in moral-personal, moral-impersonal, and nonmoral dilemmas. We found that lorazepam caused a dose-dependent increase in participants' willingness to endorse responses that directly harm other humans in moral-personal dilemmas but did not significantly affect response choices in moral-impersonal dilemmas or nonmoral dilemmas. Within the set of moral-personal dilemmas that we administered, lorazepam increased the willingness to harm others in dilemmas where harm was inflicted for selfish reasons (dubbed low-conflict dilemmas) as well as responses to dilemmas where others were harmed for utilitarian reasons (i.e., for the greater good, dubbed high-conflict dilemmas). This suggests that anxiety exerts a general inhibitory effect on harmful acts toward other humans regardless of whether the motivation for those harmful acts is selfish or utilitarian. Lorazepam is also a sedative drug, but we found that lorazepam slowed decision times equally in all 3 dilemma types. This finding implies that its specific capacity to increase ruthlessness in moral-personal dilemmas was not a confound caused by sedation.","[Perkins, Adam M.; Leonard, Ania M.; Weaver, Kristin; Dalton, Jeffiey A.; Mehta, Mimi A.; Kumari, Veena; Williams, Steven C.

A PAR can lead to differential development among initially similar individuals, and increase evolutionary fitness. Despite many theories and empirical observations of PAR-like changes in depressive tendencies, clear empirical findings on human personality changes following depressive symptoms are lacking, possibly because these changes take a long time to develop and most follow up studies have been short Here we show that in sufficiently long (5- and 15-year) clinical and general-population follow ups, increases can be observed in the Temperament and Character Inventory's personality trait harm avoidance as a function of temporally accumulating major depressive episodes (132 depression patients from Vantaa Depression Study) and depressive symptoms (3105 participants from Young Finns general-population sample). Personality changes did not occur in the other six personality traits of the inventory, but did in a highly similar neuroticism trait from another inventory. Even when controlling for concurrent changes in depressive symptoms from the baseline to the endpoint depressive symptoms that occurred during the follow-up period associated with harm-avoidance changes, rendering individuals more fearful and anticipating harm. This study provides consistent, specific, and plausible dose-response and temporal gradients between accumulated depressive episodes and personality change. Effect sizes were between small to moderate, though. Altogether, the findings support the feasibility of using existing systems of personality assessment (i.e., self-report questionnaires) to study PARs, despite the multiplicity of the systems.

In this longitudinal study, we examined the influence of kinship on the maintenance costs of social relationships. We followed 25 students over an 18-month period as they made the transition from school to university and examined the association between kinship, relationship maintenance and decay. The emotional intensity of friendships, in comparison to kin relations, was more sensitive to decreases in contact frequency and more sensitive to decreases in the number of activities done together. These results demonstrate that important differences between kin relations and friendships emerge when the relationships are considered longitudinally and suggest that the costs of maintaining friendships are much higher than the costs of maintaining kin relations.

Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i. e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world.

One theory posits that even early in development, linguistic labels function as category markers and thus are different from the features of the stimuli they represent. Another theory holds that early in development, labels are akin to other features, but that they may become category markers in the course of development. We addressed this issue in two experiments with 4-to 5-year-olds and adults. In both experiments, participants performed a categorization task (in which they predicted a category label) and an induction task (in which they predicted a missing feature). In the latter task, the category label was pitted against a highly salient feature, such that reliance on the label and reliance on the salient feature would result in different patterns of responses. Results indicated that children relied on the salient feature when performing induction, whereas many adults relied on the category label. These results suggest that early in development, labels are no more than features, but that they may become category markers in the course of development.","[Deng, Wei (Sophia)] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Ctr Cognit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Deng, W (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 209C Ohio Stadium E,1961 Tuttle Pk Pl, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",deng.69@osu.edu,NICHD NIH HHS [R01HD056105],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,2012,23,2,10.1177/0956797611429133,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,WOS:000300955900013,178-186,Deng,Wei (Sophia),12-Feb,Deng_PsychologSci_2012_jbxw1.pdf,Results indicated that children relied on the salient feature when performing induction,Results indicated that children relied on the salient feature when performing induction,0,1,3937,(x1: 525.95 y1: 323.47) (x2: 370.10 y2: 341.28),Our research showed that young children exhibit over- whelming reliance on a highly salient feature and not on a cat- egory label,Our research showed that young children exhibit over- whelming reliance on a highly salient feature and not on a cat- egory label,0,8,3151,(x1: 319.50 y1: 72.08) (x2: 353.54 y2: 101.62),"in the induction condition, children made more label-consistent responses on high-match trials than on low-match trials, paired-samples t(11) = 12.85, p < .01, d = 5.27","...in the induction condition, children made more label-consistent responses on high-match trials than on low-match trials, paired-samples t(11) = 12.85, p < .01, d = 5.27.",0,5,2140,(x1: 531.06 y1: 573.59) (x2: 497.18 y2: 615.13),"paired-samples t(11) = 12.85, p < .01, d = 5.27","paired-samples t(11) = 12.85, p < .01, d = 5.27",5,2261,(x1: 307.50 y1: 609.59) (x2: 497.18 y2: 615.13),Vladimir M.

Critically, we varied the reward priority of singleton colors (correct fast performance was worth more bonus points for red singletons than for green singletons, or vice versa) to test whether event-related potential signatures of visual selection can be affected by distinct reward priorities for different target types, even when every target has to be selected for report. The N2pc component was earlier and larger for high- than for low-reward targets. This influence of reward on the N2pc correlated with the subject-by-subject impact of reward level on efficiency of behavioral performance. Later postselection processing was also affected by reward level. These results demonstrate that visual selection of task-relevant items is rapidly modulated by reward-related priorities, even when every target has to be selected for response.","[Kiss, Monika; Eimer, Martin] Birkbeck Coll London, Sch Psychol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Driver, Jon] UCL, UCL Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Kiss, M (reprint author), Birkbeck Coll London, Sch Psychol, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",m.kiss@bbk.ac.uk,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council (United Kingdom); Royal Society Leverhulme-Trust Senior Research Fellowship; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBS/B/16186, BB/E02470X/1]; Medical Research Council [G0500784]",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,2009,20,2,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02281.x,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,WOS:000262953800019,245-251,Kiss,Monika,9-Feb,Kiss_PsychologSci_2009_q7nr9.pdf,The N2pc component was earlier and larger for high- than for low-reward targets.,The N2pc component was earlier and larger for high- than for low-reward targets.,0,1,775,(x1: 79.14 y1: 467.72) (x2: 207.28 y2: 485.07),"However, if the rapid selection process that the N2pc signifies can be sensitive to reward-related prioritization, a faster or in- creased N2pc would be expected specifically for high-reward targets, despite their equivalence to the alternative target type in all other respects.","However, if the rapid selection process that the N2pc signifies can be sensitive to reward-related prioritization, a faster or in- creased N2pc would be expected specifically for high-reward targets, despite their equivalence to the alternative target type in all other respects.",0,2,3702,(x1: 321.05 y1: 505.85) (x2: 399.01 y2: 560.80),"there was a Reward Level  Contralaterality inter- action, F(1, 13) 5 6.7, prep 5 .95, Zp 2 ¼ :341, because N2pc amplitudes were larger for high- than for low-reward targets.","…there was a Reward Level  X Contralaterality interaction, F(1, 13) = 6.7, p_rep (probability of replicating an effect in the same direction) = .95, partial eta-squared = .341, because N2pc amplitudes were larger for high- than for low-reward targets.",0,4,3359,(x1: 364.42 y1: 656.83) (x2: 567.01 y2: 686.61),"probability of replicating an effect in the same direction | F(1, 13) 5 6.7, prep 5 .95, Zp 2 ¼ :341","F(1, 13) = 6.7, p_rep (probability of replicating an effect in the same direction) = .95, partial eta-squared = .341",4 | 4,1010,(x1: 197.18 y1: 267.35) (x2: 175.00 y2: 284.66) | (x1: 350.53 y1: 669.26) (x2: 505.85 y2: 674.08),Monika Kiss,m.kiss@bbk.ac.uk,1,vd8rz

In Experiment 1, participants observed 47 choices made by others and ranked them by how strongly each choice suggested that the decision maker had a preference for a specific item. An inverse decision-making model generated predictions that were in accordance with participants' inferences. Experiment 2 replicated and extended a previous study by Newtson (1974) in which participants observed pairs of choices and made judgments about which choice provided stronger evidence for a preference.

The effect of auditory verbal imagery on signal detection in hallucination-prone individuals,Moseley,Peter,2016,10.1016/j.cognition.2015.09.015,0010-0277,Cognition,Cognition,Cognition,FALSE,"Moseley, Peter; Smailes, David; Ellison, Amanda; Fernyhough, Charles",The effect of auditory verbal imagery on signal detection in hallucination-prone individuals,COGNITION,English,Auditory imagery; Inner speech; Hallucinations; Imagery-perception interaction,SELF-GENERATED SPEECH; INNER SPEECH; REALITY DISCRIMINATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POPULATION; PSYCHOSIS; PHENOMENOLOGY; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; CONTINUUM,"Cognitive models have suggested that auditory hallucinations occur when internal mental events, such as inner speech or auditory verbal imagery (AVI), are misattributed to an external source. This has been supported by numerous studies indicating that individuals who experience hallucinations tend to perform in a biased manner on tasks that require them to distinguish self-generated from non-self-generated perceptions. However, these tasks have typically been of limited relevance to inner speech models of hallucinations, because they have not manipulated the AVI that participants used during the task. Here, a new paradigm was employed to investigate the interaction between imagery and perception, in which a healthy, non-clinical sample of participants were instructed to use AVI whilst completing an auditory signal detection task. It was hypothesized that AVI-usage would cause participants to perform in a biased manner, therefore falsely detecting more voices in bursts of noise. In Experiment 1, when cued to generate AVI, highly hallucination-prone participants showed a lower response bias than when performing a standard signal detection task, being more willing to report the presence of a voice in the noise. Participants not prone to hallucinations performed no differently between the two conditions. In Experiment 2, participants were not specifically instructed to use AVI, but retrospectively reported how often they engaged in AVI during the task Highly hallucination-prone participants who retrospectively,reported using imagery showed a lower response bias than did participants with lower proneness who also reported using AVI. Results are discussed in relation to prominent inner speech models of hallucinations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Inhibitory control was gauged by lag-2 task repetition costs, namely decreased performance on the final trial of sequences of type ABA relative to CBA, due to persisting inhibition of the recently abandoned task. Bilinguals had larger lag-2 repetition costs, which reflect stronger inhibition of a no-longer relevant task to facilitate a switch into a new task. Monitoring ability was measured by the fadeout effect, which reflects adaptation to simpler task demands when a single task block immediately and unexpectedly follows mixed task blocks. Bilinguals did not differ from monolinguals in the magnitude or trajectory of the fade-out effect. Thus, results support the notion of increased bilingual inhibitory control, even when it is detrimental to performance, and do not demonstrate a specific bilingual advantage in monitoring. These findings are discussed in the context of the recent debate concerning the locus of bilingual advantages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The present experiments aimed to determine whether listeners actually perceive such rhythmic differences in a purely musical context (i.e., in instrumental music without words). In Experiment 1a, listeners successfully classified instrumental renditions of French and English songs having highly contrastive rhythmic differences. Experiment 1b replicated this result with the same songs containing rhythmic information only. In Experiments 2a and 2b, listeners successfully classified original and rhythm-only stimuli when language-specific rhythmic differences were less contrastive but more representative of differences found in actual music and speech. These findings indicate that listeners can use rhythmic similarities and differences to classify songs originally composed in two languages having contrasting rhythmic prosody. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, this work focuses on the identification of stable associations between personality on the factor and facet level, fluid intelligence, demography and app usage in 16 distinct categories. A total of 137 subjects (87 women and 50 men), with an average age of 24 (SD=4.72), participated in a 90-min psychometric lab session as well as in a subsequent 60-day data logging study in the field. Our data suggest that personality traits predict mobile application usage in several specific categories such as communication, photography, gaming, transportation and entertainment. Extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness are better predictors of mobile application usage than basic demographic variables in several distinct categories. Furthermore, predictive performance is slightly higher for single factorin comparison with facet-level personality scores. Fluid intelligence and demographics additionally show stable associations with categorical app usage. In sum, this study demonstrates how individual differences can be effectively related to actual behaviour and how this can assist in understanding the behavioural underpinnings of personality.

In Turkey, collective narcissists responded with schadenfreude to the European economic crisis after feeling humiliated by the Turkish wait to be admitted to the European Union (Study 1). In Portugal, they supported hostile actions towards Germans and rejoiced in the German economic crisis after perceiving Germany's position in the European Union as more important than the position of Portugal (Study 2). In Poland, they supported hostile actions towards the makers of a movie they found offensive to Poland (Studies 3 and 5) and responded with direct and indirect hostility towards a celebrity whose jokes about the Polish government they found offensive (Study 4).

In a solidarity game, subjects are asked to make decisions about transferring money to other players in a case in which they win a random draw and the other players lose. The results of four studies showed the following: (1) JS explains a unique portion of variance in the solidarity behaviour, above and beyond other basic personality dimensions (e.g. HEXACO model); (2) its effect does not depend on contextual factors, such as the degree of moral entitlement not to share and the possibility to attribute the recipients' disadvantage to their own responsibility; and (3) individual differences in the emotions anticipated in response to different outcomes of a random draw and the cognitive interpretation of the allocation situation partially mediate the effect of JS on solidarity behaviour.

Due to the portion size effect, people tend to eat more when they are served a larger, as opposed to a smaller, portion. Here, spontaneous simulations of the experience of eating a portion of food by consumers (i.e., simulated eating) helped to reduce this portion size effect. Those participants who reported more eating simulations selected a smaller percentage of food from the very large portion. However, the quantity of food selected from this very large portion was nevertheless still larger than from the medium portion. Thus, simulated eating reduced but did not eliminate entirely the portion size effect. However, when the participants were encouraged to deliberatively imagine the sensory experiences associated with eating a portion of food (imagined eating), initial portion size no longer influenced the amount of food selected. Potential implications of these results for the consumer, for the food industry, and for public health are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The present research examined the relationship between narcissism and advice taking. In particular, we studied the mechanisms that explain why narcissists are dismissive of advice. In three studies, we found that narcissism and advice taking were negatively related, but only when measuring narcissism at the state level or when controlling for extraversion at the trait level. We also tested two mechanisms and found that confidence did not mediate the relationship; disregard for others did. In Study 4, participants were placed under different accountability pressures to affect self-enhancement. Results showed that the narcissism-advice taking relationship was strongly negative under process accountability. Taken together, these results suggest that narcissists eschew advice not because of greater confidence, but because they think others are incompetent and because they fail to reduce their self-enhancement when expecting to be assessed.

Just as important, this research has largely suggested few effects for ILT congruence, focused exclusively on prototype congruence, examined a limited number of potential outcomes, and has failed to examine questions about ILT congruence utilizing the most appropriate statistical approaches. We examine the effects of ILT congruence, with an explicit focus on the possibility that congruence between supervisors and their employees on both prototypes and antiprototypes impacts the LMX developed within their dyads. We predict that LMX, in turn, affects employees' opportunities to engage in developmental activities. Using a sample of 74 matched pairs of supervisors and employees and polynomial regression and response surface methodology, we found that congruence between supervisors' and employees' prototypes positively influenced LMX. We also found limited evidence that LMX explained the effects of this congruence on employees' engagement in developmental activities. Although we found no evidence of antiprototype congruence effects, supervisors who rated antiprototypical traits as characteristic of leaders had lower LMX with their employees.

Supported by recent extensions of the job Demand-Control model (JD-C; Karasek, 1979; Meier, Semmer, Elfering, & jacobshagen, 2008), we suggest that individuals who exhibit proactive voice behaviors and perceive that they are better able to manage their resources will experience less dissatisfaction, emotional exhaustion, turnover intentions, and reductions in work effort when faced with perceived supervisory abuse than those not demonstrating proactive voice and incapable of managing their resources. Cross-sample findings demonstrated support for our hypotheses. Implications for theory and practice, strengths and limitations, and avenues for additional research are discussed.

Math-intensive but less social jobs-including many STEM occupations-shrank by 3.3 percentage points over the same period. Employment and wage growth were particularly strong for jobs requiring high levels of both math skill and social skills. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of team production where workers ""trade tasks"" to exploit their comparative advantage. In the model, social skills reduce coordination costs, allowing workers to specialize and work together more efficiently. The model generates predictions about sorting and the relative returns to skill across occupations, which I investigate using data from the NLSY79 and the NLSY97.

However, as the sector-specific labor requirements of a business opportunity increase, both breadth of knowledge and leadership experience allow founders to operate their firms with fewer employees.","[Dencker, John C.] Univ Illinois, Sch Labor & Employment Relat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gruber, Marc] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Shah, Sonali K.] Univ Washington, Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Dencker, JC (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Sch Labor & Employment Relat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dencker@illinois.edu; marc.grtiber@epfl.ch; sonali@alum.mit.edu,,ACAD MANAGEMENT,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",0001-4273,1948-0989,2009,52,6,10.5465/amj.2009.47084648,Business; Management,Business & Economics,WOS:000273758300003,1125-1147,Dencker,John C.,9-Dec,Dencker_AcaManageJourn_2009_wvlzy.pdf,Our findings reveal that an entrepreneur’s breadth of knowledge has a negative influence on the firm’s job creation,Our findings reveal that an entrepreneur’s breadth of knowledge has a negative influence on the firm’s job creation,0,1,574,(x1: 117.68 y1: 269.74) (x2: 268.73 y2: 286.12),Hypothesis 1a.

First, the MAC is revealed by the price of traded permits.

These indirect effects have not been examined in adults with substance dependence and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. We examined mediators and moderators of the effects of neurocognitive impairment on substance use among adults in treatment for alcohol or drug dependence and major depression (MDD). Method: Participants were veterans (N = 197, mean age = 49.3 years, 90% male, 75% Caucasian) in a trial of 2 group interventions for alcohol/drug dependence and MDD. Measures examined here included intake neurocognitive assessments and percent days drinking (PDD), percent days using drugs (PDDRG), self-efficacy, 12-step affiliation, and depressive symptoms measured every 3 months from intake to the 18-month follow-up. Results: Greater intake neurocognitive impairment predicted lower self-efficacy, lower 12-step affiliation, and greater depression severity, and these time-varying variables mediated the effects of impairment on future PDD and PDDRG. The prospective effects of 12-step affiliation on future PDD were greater for those with greater neurocognitive impairment. Impairment also interacted with depression to moderate the effects of 12-step affiliation and self-efficacy on PDD. Adults with greater impairment and currently severe depression had the strongest associations between 12-step affiliation/self-efficacy and future drinking. Conclusions: Greater neurocognitive impairment may lead to poorer outcomes from group therapy for alcohol/drug dependence and MDD due to compromised change in therapeutic processes. Distal factors such as neurocognitive impairment can interact with dynamic risk factors to modulate the association between therapeutic processes and future drinking outcomes.","[Worley, Matthew J.] San Diego State Univ Univ Calif San Diego Joint D, San Diego, CA USA; [Tate, Susan R.; Granholm, Eric] Vet Affairs San Diego Hlth Care Syst, San Diego, CA USA; [Tate, Susan R.; Granholm, Eric; Brown, Sandra A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Brown, Sandra A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Worley, MJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Family Med, 10880 Wilshire Blvd,Suite 1800, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",mworley@mednet.ucla.edu,"NIDA NIH HHS [F31 DA030861, F31DA030861]",AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-006X,1939-2117,2014,82,3,10.1037/a0036033,"Psychology, Clinical",Psychology,WOS:000337896700004,418-428,Worley,Matthew J.,14-Jun,Worley_JournConsClinPsy_2014_vpw7v.pdf,"Greater intake neurocognitive impairment predicted lower self-efficacy, lower 12-step affiliation, and greater depression severity, and these time-varying variables mediated the effects of impairment on future PDD and PDDRG.","Greater intake neurocognitive impairment predicted lower self-efficacy, lower 12-step affiliation, and greater depression severity, and these time-varying variables mediated the effects of impairment on future PDD and PDDRG.",0,1,1350,(x1: 419.46 y1: 311.04) (x2: 158.11 y2: 345.50),We hypoth- esized that the effects of neurocognitive impairment on drinking and drug use during treatment and follow-up would be mediated by lower self-efficacy,We hypoth- esized that the effects of neurocognitive impairment on drinking and drug use during treatment and follow-up would be mediated by lower self-efficacy,0,2,5222,(x1: 503.40 y1: 341.98) (x2: 387.76 y2: 380.00),"For PDD, the effects of neurocognitive impairment were significantly mediated by self-efficacy (b  0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.64], p  .05, propor- tion of direct effect [PDE]  43%)","For PDD, the effects of neurocognitive impairment were significantly mediated by self-efficacy (b = 0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.64], p < .05, proportion of direct effect [PDE] = 43%)...",0,5,4625,(x1: 497.66 y1: 638.98) (x2: 435.03 y2: 677.00),"b  0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.64], p  .05, propor- tion of direct effect [PDE]  43%)","b = 0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.64], p < .05, proportion of direct effect [PDE] = 43%",5,4721,(x1: 368.48 y1: 661.05) (x2: 435.03 y2: 677.00),Matthew J.

Method: Data were drawn from a randomized effectiveness trial in which 306 female high school students (mean age = 15.7 years, SD = 1.1) with body image concerns were randomized to the 4-session dissonance-based prevention program or an educational brochure control condition, wherein school counselors and nurses were responsible for participant recruitment and intervention delivery. Results: Dissonance-intervention participants showed greater reductions in thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorder symptoms; change in thin-ideal internalization predicted change in body dissatisfaction and symptoms; change in body dissatisfaction predicted change in symptoms; and all indirect effects were significant. Change in thin-ideal internalization fully mediated the effects of intervention condition on change in body dissatisfaction and partially mediated the effects on symptoms; change in body dissatisfaction partially mediated the effect of intervention condition on change in symptoms.

Creditors demand and managers consent to a more restrictive Payout policy as a substitute for weak creditor rights in an effort to minimize the firm's agency costs of debt. Using a sample of 120,507 firm-years from 52 countries, we find that both the probability and amount of dividend payouts are significantly lower in countries with poor creditor rights. A reduction in the creditor rights index from its highest value to its lowest value implies a 41% reduction in the probability of paying a dividend, and a 60% reduction in dividend payout ratios. These results are robust to numerous control variables, sample variations, model specifications, and alternative hypotheses. We also show that the agency costs of debt play a more decisive role in determining dividend policies than the previously documented agency costs of equity. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing literature arguing that creditors exert significant influence over corporate decision-making outside of bankruptcy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large longitudinal university-employer-employee dataset, we find that the cost of recessions for new graduates is substantial and unequal. Unlucky graduates suffer persistent earnings declines lasting ten years. They start to work for lower paying employers, and then partly recover through a gradual process of mobility toward better firms. We document that more advantaged graduates suffer less from graduating in recessions because they switch to better firms quickly, while earnings of less advantaged graduates can be permanently affected by cyclical downgrading.","[Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada; [von Wachter, Till] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [von Wachter, Till] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10025 USA; [von Wachter, Till] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Heisz, Andrew] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada","Oreopoulos, P (reprint author), Univ Toronto, 150 St George St,Suite 311, Toronto, ON M5S 3G6, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca; vw2112@columbia.edu; Andrew.Heisz@statcan.gc.ca,,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,2012,4,1,10.1257/app.4.1.1,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000299169300001,29-Jan,Oreopoulos,Philip,12-Jan,Oreopoulos_AmEcoJourn_2012_5klmz.pdf,This paper analyzes the magnitude and sources of long-term earnings declines associated with graduating from college during a recession. | Unlucky graduates suffer persistent earnings declines lasting ten years.,This paper analyzes the magnitude and sources of long-term earnings declines associated with graduating from college during a recession. | Unlucky graduates suffer persistent earnings declines lasting ten years.,0,1 | 1,1410 | 1694,(x1: 93.01 y1: 177.00) (x2: 393.03 y2: 195.05) | (x1: 154.30 y1: 225.00) (x2: 167.66 y2: 243.05),temporary labor market conditions could lead to lasting declines in earnings if employers learn only gradually about the quality of a graduating cohort after an initial down ranking to lower paying jobs,temporary labor market conditions could lead to lasting declines in earnings if employers learn only gradually about the quality of a graduating cohort after an initial down ranking to lower paying jobs,0,4,2796,(x1: 97.19 y1: 530.87) (x2: 238.72 y2: 563.01),Our main results are drawn from regional models that include cohort effects as well as effects for province of first residence | Estimates with standard errors are shown in col- umn 3 of panel A in Table 1.17 The coefficients demonstrate that the effect on a high unemployment rate at graduation converges to zero only after ten experience years.,"Our main results are drawn from regional models that include cohort effects as well as effects for province of first residence...Estimates with standard errors are shown in column 3 of panel A in Table 1.

Our central finding was that indigenous spirituality was associated with poorer psychological outcomes across several domains (depressive symptoms, anger, anxiety, somatization, and interpersonal difficulties), but observed effects were attenuated once perceived discrimination and historical losses were added to statistical models. Thus, consideration of relevant stressors drastically changed our conclusions, underscoring the uncertain dynamics through which specific Indigenous cultural factors impact mental health.

We find that funds using less verifiable pricing sources and funds that provide managers with greater discretion in pricing investment positions are more likely to have returns consistent with intentional smoothing. Traditional controls, however, such as removing the manager from the setting and reporting of the fund's net asset value and the use of reputable auditors and administrators, are not associated with lower levels of smoothing.

The current research broadens this view, arguing that people additionally experience varying degrees of decision comfort that are distinct from other post-decision evaluations. The authors argue that comfort is a soft-positive emotion thus far unexamined in relation to decision processes and present nine studies that (1) develop and validate two scales to measure decision comfort, (2) demonstrate the discriminant validity of decision comfort relative to numerous other post-decision constructs, and (3) examine the unique downstream consequences of decision comfort. The results show that an individual may be quite comfortable with a decision despite being uncertain about the optimality and/or the anticipated consequences of that decision (e. g., satisfaction or regret). It is demonstrated that decision comfort responds to affect-relevant cues and tends to rely less on comparisons between the chosen and foregone options (i. e., it tends to be a less comparative evaluation). Decision comfort is also shown to account for a sizable proportion of consumers' overall decision evaluations and to have meaningful downstream consequences on marketing-relevant variables (e. g., choice commitment and the likelihood of recommending).","[Parker, Jeffrey R.] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Mkt, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lehmann, Donald R.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Business, 3022 Broadway,507 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Xie, Yi] Univ Int Business & Econ, Mkt, Sch Business, Room 412,Ningyuan Bldg,10 Huixin Xi Jie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Parker, JR (reprint author), Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Mkt, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jeffparker@gsu.edu; drl2@columbia.edu; xieyipku@gmail.com,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2016,43,1,10.1093/jcr/ucw010,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000397935600007,113-133,Parker,Jeffrey R.,16-Jun,Parker_JournConsRes_2016_o5plg.pdf,"Decision comfort is also shown to account for a sizable proportion of consumers’ overall decision evaluations and to have meaningful downstream consequences on marketing-relevant variables (e.g., choice commitment and the likelihood of recommending).","Decision comfort is also shown to account for a sizable proportion of consumers’ overall decision evaluations and to have meaningful downstream consequences on marketing-relevant variables (e.g., choice commitment and the likelihood of recommending).",0,1,1261,(x1: 433.70 y1: 341.71) (x2: 457.66 y2: 372.64),we predicted that decision comfort would be significantly more positively correlated with the preference to keep the money invested.,we predicted that decision comfort would be significantly more positively correlated with the preference to keep the money invested.,0,15,2292,(x1: 169.69 y1: 565.60) (x2: 285.59 y2: 593.31),"These predictions were tested via linear regressions us- ing participants’ self-rated decision comfort, decision con- fidence, anticipated regret, and subjective financial expertise as predictors. | participants’ desire to keep their money invested in their chosen fund—as op- posed to withdrawing it completely—was significantly pre- dicted only by their decision comfort (b ¼ .437, t ¼ 6.15, p < .001).","These predictions were tested via linear regressions using participants’ self-rated decision comfort, decision confidence, anticipated regret, and subjective financial expertise as predictors...participants’ desire to keep their money invested in their chosen fund—as opposed to withdrawing it completely—was significantly predicted only by their decision comfort (b = .437, t = 6.15, p < .001).",0,15 | 15,2508 | 3068,(x1: 56.75 y1: 623.15) (x2: 142.01 y2: 662.31) | (x1: 458.14 y1: 93.92) (x2: 349.03 y2: 144.65),"b ¼ .437, t ¼ 6.15, p < .001","b = .437, t = 6.15, p < .001",15,3243,(x1: 474.35 y1: 128.13) (x2: 343.20 y2: 144.65),na,na,1,27zml

Although these labels may exert a systematic influence on responses since they are common to all items, academic research on the effect of different labels is surprisingly scarce.

This article examines the role of psychological distance (temporal and geographical) in consumers' assortment size decisions and rectifies contradicting hypotheses produced by construal level theory. Six studies demonstrate that while consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when choices pertain to distant locations and times. This decrease in preference for large assortments is due to psychological distance increasing the similarity of the options in a category, making them appear more substitutable. This effect of psychological distance reverses when consumers consider desirability/feasibility trade-off information inherent in the assortment size decision. These findings point to important outcomes of psychological distance, resolving opposing predictions of construal level theory, and identify boundary conditions for the well-established notion that consumers are attracted to large assortments.","[Goodman, Joseph K.; Malkoc, Selin A.] Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Goodman, JK (reprint author), Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",goodman@wustl.edu; malkoc@wustl.edu,,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2012,39,4,10.1086/665047,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000311149300006,751-768,Goodman,Joseph K.,12-Dec,Goodman_JournConsRes_2012_j9w36.pdf,"Six studies demonstrate that while consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when choices pertain to distant locations and times.","Six studies demonstrate that while consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when choices pertain to distant locations and times.",0,1,624,(x1: 517.44 y1: 305.68) (x2: 427.40 y2: 337.19),"H1: When the feasibility/desirability trade-off is not salient, increasing psychological distance will de- crease preference for the large assortment.","H1: When the feasibility/desirability trade-off is not salient, increasing psychological distance will de- crease preference for the large assortment.",0,4,3193,(x1: 73.72 y1: 677.63) (x2: 266.73 y2: 705.29),"We expected that preference for the larger assortment, which has been repeatedly demonstrated in the literature, would be observed when the decision is temporally proximal and would be reduced or eliminated when the decision is farther out in the future.

The empirical results from multilevel data sets of two U.S.-based corporations reveal that district CI quality diversity weakens the positive performance effect of CI quality at both levels.

Drawing on the transactional model of stress and stress rigidity theory, we thus examine linkages between acute stressors and upper- and lower-level supportive leadership climates for teams of leaders. Employing survey data collected by the U.S. Army from military leaders and their subordinate soldiers in combat, we found support for a negative relationship between acute stressors and lower-level supportive leadership climate. Additionally, upper-level supportive leadership climate moderated the stressors-supportive leadership linkage, such that when upper-level supportive leadership climate was low, there was a more negative relationship between acute stressors and leaders providing supportive leadership to followers. In turn, this lower-level supportive leadership climate resulting from the acute stressors and upper-level supportive leadership climate interaction promoted followers' social cohesion.

Results showed that, compared to the non-trained leaders, the trained leaders registered an improvement in their enactment of leadership functions.

The model was tested on a sample of 95 service employees and on 485 interactions between these employees and their customers.

Instrumental variables (IV) estimation of the payoff to choosing one type of education compared to another is made particularly challenging by individuals choosing between several types of education. Not only does identification require one instrument per alternative, but it is also necessary to deal with the issue that individuals who choose the same education may have different next-best alternatives. We address these difficulties using rich administrative data for Norway's postsecondary education system. A centralized admission process creates credible instruments from discontinuities that effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different institutions and fields of study. The admission process also provides information on preferred and next-best alternatives from strategy-proof measures of individuals' ranking of institutions and fields. The results from our IV approach may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, different fields of study have substantially different labor market payoffs, even after accounting for institution and peer quality. Second, the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study. Third, the estimated payoffs to field of study are consistent with individuals choosing fields in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparing our estimates to those obtained from other approaches highlights the importance of using instruments to correct for selection bias and information on individuals' ranking of institutions and fields to measure their preferred and next-best alternatives.","[Kirkeboen, Lars J.; Leuven, Edwin; Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Kirkeboen, LJ (reprint author), Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com,Norwegian Research Council's Programme for Research and Innovation in the Education Sector (FINNUT) [237840],OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,2016,131,3,10.1093/qje/qjw019,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000383326100001,1057-1111,Kirkeboen,Lars J.,16-Aug,Kirkeboen_QuartJournEco_2016_mp438.pdf,"This article examines the labor market payoffs to different types of postsec- ondary education, including field and institution of study. | the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study.","This article examines the labor market payoffs to different types of postsec- ondary education, including field and institution of study. | the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study.",0,1 | 1,162 | 1421,(x1: 94.62 y1: 269.19) (x2: 301.42 y2: 283.35) | (x1: 111.85 y1: 428.61) (x2: 332.88 y2: 442.72),"when disentan- gling the causal contribution of institution and field of study, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in the payoffs to postsecondary education.","when disentan- gling the causal contribution of institution and field of study, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in the payoffs to postsecondary education.",0,4,666,(x1: 280.46 y1: 206.80) (x2: 170.73 y2: 248.49),"Table IV reports the 2SLS estimates | By estimating the model separately by next-best field, we are able to identify the payoffs to different fields while correcting for selection bias and keeping the next- best alternatives as measured at the time of application fixed.

Engaging in such behavior is called ""short selling,"" and it has increased considerably among publicly traded North American firms in recent years. This study builds on threat rigidity theory to develop arguments about the behavioral consequences of short sellers. We theorize that, when firms have a high level of short interest, managers adopt a defensive stance by halting new growth initiatives and limiting the range of growth modes in which they participate. We also suggest that managers' ability to process information and exercise control moderate these main effects. Specifically, we argue that managers will be less reactionary when firms have high absorptive capacity, possess high board centrality, maintain sufficient financial slack, and are well regarded by the media.

This, in turn, implies that heterogeneity in investment manager skill, if present, should be most clearly visible among managers that focus on asset classes with less informationally efficient prices. We investigate this argument using a large sample of syndicated bank loan portfolios managed by collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers. Using a CLO's equity tranche cashon-cash return to measure performance, we find strong persistence that is robust to an extensive set of risk controls. Although investors seem to derive their expectation about management quality from a manager's realized performance and allocate more capital to ""skilled"" managers, top performers cope to stay ahead of net-of-fees.

We study individuals' decisions to avoid monitoring or regulation and thus enhance their ability to engage in unethical conduct. We conduct a laboratory experiment in which participants engage in a competitive task and can decide between having the opportunity to misreport their performance or having their performance verified by an external monitor. To study the effect of social factors on the willingness to be subject to monitoring, we vary whether participants make this decision simultaneously with others or sequentially, as well as whether the decision is private or public.

We posit that managers of matrix firms' greater familiarity with coordination, knowledge sharing, and conflict management challenges in intraorganizational collaboration gives them greater confidence in their ability to manage similar challenges in complex alliances. Using a combination of quantitative data analysis and semistructured interviews, we find support for our core prediction that matrix firms are more likely than nonmatrix firms to enter into complex alliances. Unexpectedly, we find that the stock market penalizes matrix firms that engage in multifunctional alliances, a phenomenon we suggest reflects a ""double-complexity discount."" The double-complexity discount refers to reduced organizational outcomes incurred for the simultaneous complexity of intra- and interorganizational governance structures. This study raises questions about the benefits and costs of firms' simultaneously engaging in complex intra- and interorganizational governance structures, with particular attention to the difference between managerial confidence and competence regarding complex collaboration challenges.","[Sytch, Maxim] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Wohlgezogen, Franz] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Zajac, Edward J.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Sytch, M (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",msytch@umich.edu; fwohlgezogen@unimelb.edu.au; e-zajac@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,INFORMS,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1047-7039,1526-5455,2018,29,6,10.1287/orsc.2018.1220,Management,Business & Economics,WOS:000454417400008,1130-1148,Sytch,Maxim,NOV-DEC 2018,Sytch_OrgSci_2018_kw0yd.pdf,"Using a combination of quantitative data analysis and semistructured interviews, we find support for our core prediction that matrix firms are more likely than nonmatrix firms to enter into complex alliances.","Using a combination of quantitative data analysis and semistructured interviews, we find support for our core prediction that matrix firms are more likely than nonmatrix firms to enter into complex alliances.",0,2,1616,(x1: 263.28 y1: 288.43) (x2: 384.85 y2: 314.81),Hypothesis 3.

Existing publications emphasize the importance of time sensitivity but also reflect divergent, untested perspectives. Prior works do not clearly explain or examine how different mechanisms are associated with achieving time-sensitive versus general (or non-time-sensitive) performance. We build on concepts from organizational mindfulness and organizational routines to address these gaps. Specifically, this paper examines how the mindful use of information technologies and adherence to specified routines are associated with both time-sensitive and general organizational performance. We employ split-group structural equation modeling based on high and low levels of information technology adoption to account for potential technology contingencies in performance. We use time-sequenced data from 262 U.S. hospitals to analyze two categories of clinical care quality: time-sensitive care and general care. The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with both time-sensitive and general performance in contexts with high technology adoption but not in those with low adoption. In contrast, adherence to specified routines is associated with time-sensitive performance in contexts with low technology adoption but not in those with high adoption. The results also clarify that high levels of technology adoption and mindful use may at times assume the place of specified routines in their association with time-sensitive performance. Finally, we find evidence that continuous improvement may bridge adherence to specified routines and mindful use of technologies.","[Gardner, John W.] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Boyer, Kenneth K.; Ward, Peter T.] Ohio State Univ, Max M Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Gardner, JW (reprint author), Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",johnwgardner@byu.edu; boyer.9@osu.edu; ward.1@osu.edu,,INFORMS,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1047-7039,1526-5455,2017,28,6,10.1287/orsc.2017.1159,Management,Business & Economics,WOS:000423267700005,1061-1079,Gardner,John W.,NOV-DEC 2017,Gardner_OrgSci_2017_9bn20.pdf,The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with | time-sensitive | performance in contexts with high technology adoption,The results indicate that mindful use of technologies is associated with | time-sensitive | performance in contexts with high technology adoption,0,2 | 2 | 2,1902 | 1980 | 2007,(x1: 253.44 y1: 330.43) (x2: 533.65 y2: 336.60) | (x1: 201.24 y1: 340.89) (x2: 256.23 y2: 347.06) | (x1: 306.01 y1: 340.89) (x2: 524.08 y2: 347.06),"Hypothesis 1 (H1).

Using five studies, we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to qualify for a study. The extent of misrepresentation can be unacceptably high, and the responses to subsequent questions can have little correspondence to responses from appropriately identified participants. We recommend a number of remedies to deal with the problem, largely involving strategies to take away the economic motive to misrepresent and to make it difficult for Turkers to recognize that a particular response will gain them access to a study. The major short-run solution involves a two-survey process that first asks respondents to identify their characteristics when there is no motive to deceive, and then limits the second survey to those who have passed this screen. The long-run recommendation involves building an ongoing MTurk participant pool (""panel"") that (1) continuously collects information that could be used to classify respondents, and (2) eliminates from the panel those who misrepresent themselves.","[Wessling, Kathryn Sharpe] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Huber, Joel] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Netzer, Oded] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 3022 Broadway,Uris Hall 520, New York, NY 10027 USA","Wessling, KS (reprint author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",wessling@wharton.upenn.edu; joel.huber@duke.edu; onetzer@gsb.columbia.edu,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2017,44,1,10.1093/jcr/ucx053,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000404534800012,211-230,Wessling,Kathryn Sharpe,17-Jun,Sharpe Wessling_JournConsRes_2017_jm2lp.pdf,"we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to qualify for a study. | and the responses to subsequent questions can have little cor- respondence to responses from appropriately identified participants.","we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to qualify for a study. | and the responses to subsequent questions can have little cor- respondence to responses from appropriately identified participants.",0,1 | 1,327 | 541,(x1: 446.46 y1: 261.71) (x2: 404.91 y2: 283.63) | (x1: 329.78 y1: 288.70) (x2: 505.66 y2: 301.66),"we demonstrate that MTurk workers are willing to misrepre- sent themselves to gain access to a desired study, and that those who do so generate distorted responses to other ques- tions in the study.","we demonstrate that MTurk workers are willing to misrepre- sent themselves to gain access to a desired study, and that those who do so generate distorted responses to other ques- tions in the study.",0,2,2195,(x1: 273.95 y1: 505.61) (x2: 119.92 y2: 557.13),"Impostors also overstated their average vitamin intake frequency (ranging from never ¼ 0 to daily ¼ 3) compared to those legitimately over 49 years old (Mimpostors ¼ 2.36; M>49 ¼ 1.96; F(1,140), p ¼ .036).

However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer's identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers' motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer's identity. This occurs because placing an identity-linked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid.","[Trudel, Remi] Boston Univ, Mkt, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02214 USA; [Argo, Jennifer J.] Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Mkt, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada; [Meng, Matthew D.] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02214 USA","Trudel, R (reprint author), Boston Univ, Mkt, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02214 USA.",rtrudel@bu.edu; jennifer.argo@ualberta.ca; mdmeng@bu.edu,Association for Consumer Research Transformative Consumer Research Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2016,43,2,10.1093/jcr/ucw014,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000397936900004,246-264,Trudel,Remi,16-Aug,Trudel_JournConsRes_2016_qvy1k.pdf,"the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer’s identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled","the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer’s identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled",0,1,487,(x1: 398.89 y1: 279.69) (x2: 501.91 y2: 301.67),"when an identity link is made salient and because consumers are motivated to maintain a positive self-concept (Steele 1988), and by ex- tension their identity is tied to the product, we expect that they will opt for the least threatening means to dispose of an identity-linked product (i.e., recycle as compared to trash).","when an identity link is made salient and because consumers are motivated to maintain a positive self-concept (Steele 1988), and by ex- tension their identity is tied to the product, we expect that they will opt for the least threatening means to dispose of an identity-linked product (i.e., recycle as compared to trash).",0,3,4237,(x1: 462.09 y1: 325.92) (x2: 334.93 y2: 400.24),"The ana- lysis revealed a significant main effect of self-identity-link, where those who wrote their own first name were signifi- cantly more likely to recycle the paper (36%) compared to those who wrote the name “Avery” (23%, b ¼ 0.320, v2(1)

The goals that they have when they engage in such imagery (e. g., a goal to construct a story of the experience vs. a goal to acquire information) can influence how the mental images they generate affect judgments. When pictures from very different perspectives are provided, those trying to imagine themselves in the scene in order to create a story of the experience have to shift visual perspectives in order to imagine the entire experience. This shift in visual perspective can increase processing difficulty and decrease evaluations of the product or service being described. When individuals are simply imagining themselves acquiring information about the product or service, however, presenting information from different perspectives has a positive impact on evaluations. Four experiments confirmed these effects and the assumptions underlying their conceptualization.","[Jiang, Yuwei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Adaval, Rashmi] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Steinhart, Yael] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Jiang, YW (reprint author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuwei.jiang@polyu.edu.hk; mkadaval@ust.hk; ysteinhart@post.tau.ac.il; mkwyer@ust.hk,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2014,41,2,10.1086/676966,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000339171400011,418-435,Jiang,Yuwei,14-Aug,Jiang_JournConsRes_2014_op7kl.pdf,presenting information from different perspectives has a positive impact on evaluations,presenting information from different perspectives has a positive impact on evaluations,0,1,1141,(x1: 519.11 y1: 388.12) (x2: 535.33 y2: 401.93),"As we hypothesized, when participants had the goal of constructing a story of their personal experience at the hotel, presenting pictures from different visual perspectives de- creased their evaluation of it.","As we hypothesized, when participants had the goal of constructing a story of their personal experience at the hotel, presenting pictures from different visual perspectives de- creased their evaluation of it.",0,7,3697,(x1: 326.77 y1: 317.87) (x2: 436.56 y2: 356.61),"When participants were disposed to form self-referent im- ages and had a story goal, ads that required a greater shift in perspective (different-perspective conditions) decreased their evaluations (from 8.22 to 7.60; F(1, 790) p 5.97, p

On the basis of theory on individualization of career trajectories, it was expected that the possibility for employees to customize their careers would be positively related to their job attitudes and subsequent objective career success, as indicated by their levels of affective commitment, work engagement, and received salary and bonuses. However, these effects were expected to occur primarily under the combination of high manager support for implementation of career customization and, on the basis of lifespan theory, older workers, as customization fulfills their increased heterogeneous career preferences. A three-wave longitudinal study largely showed support for the study hypotheses; the relation between MCC use and work engagement and subsequent career success was stronger for older workers who received support for MCC, whereas the relation between MCC use and commitment was negative for older workers who received low support. The study shows the benefits of career customization in organizations by showing the conditions under which these benefits will manifest. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Bal, P.

In Experiment 1, participants completed a goal-driven search task either with or without a map in landscapes that varied in D. In Experiment 2, participants completed a map-reading and location-judgment task in separate sets of fractal landscapes. In both experiments, task performance was highest at the low-to-mid range of D, which was previously reported as most preferred and discriminable in studies of fractal aesthetics and discrimination, respectively, supporting a theory of visual fluency. The applicability of these findings to architecture, urban planning and the general design of constructed spaces is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When resources are scarce and cannot be distributed equally, one may choose to destroy resources and reduce societal welfare to maintain equity among its members. We examined whether people are averse to inequitable outcomes per se or to being responsible for deciding how inequity should be implemented. Three scenario-based experiments and one incentivized experiment revealed that participants are inequity responsibility averse: when asked to decide which of the 2 equally deserving individuals should receive a reward, they rather discarded the reward than choosing who will get it. This tendency diminished significantly when participants had the possibility to use a random device to allocate the reward. The finding suggests that it is more difficult to be responsible for the way inequity is implemented than to create inequity per se.","[Gordon-Hecker, Tom; Rosensaft-Eshel, Daniela; Bereby-Meyer, Yoella] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Psychol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Pittarello, Andrea] Univ Groningen, Dept Org Psychol, Fac Behav & Social Sci, Org Psychol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Shalvi, Shaul] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Ctr Res Expt Econ & Polit Decis Making CREED, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Gordon-Hecker, T (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Psychol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",tomgo@post.bgu.ac.il,"Israel Science Foundation [1337/11, 914/14]",AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,2017,146,6,10.1037/xge0000273,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,WOS:000405867700002,771-775,Gordon-Hecker,Tom,17-Jun,Gordon-Hecker_JournExPsychGen_2017_q0y2l.pdf,"participants are inequity responsibility averse: when asked to decide which of the 2 equally deserving individuals should receive a reward, they rather discarded the reward than choosing who will get it.","participants are inequity responsibility averse: when asked to decide which of the 2 equally deserving individuals should receive a reward, they rather discarded the reward than choosing who will get it.",0,1,761,(x1: 257.93 y1: 306.54) (x2: 250.91 y2: 331.00),we hypothesize that people are more averse to being responsible for determining how inequity is implemented than creating inequity per se,we hypothesize that people are more averse to being responsible for determining how inequity is implemented than creating inequity per se,0,2,1800,(x1: 216.81 y1: 392.97) (x2: 237.72 y2: 419.99),"Supporting the inequity responsibility aversion hypothesis, par- ticipants were more than 8 times more likely to discard the prize in the Human Allocation condition (36.36%, 8 of 22) than in the Random Allocation condition (4.54%, 1 of 22),  2(1)  6.84, p  .011","Supporting the inequity responsibility aversion hypothesis, participants were more than 8 times more likely to discard the prize in the Human Allocation condition (36.36%, 8 of 22) than in the Random Allocation condition (4.54%, 1 of 22), chi-square(1) = 6.84, p = .011",0,2,4135,(x1: 315.00 y1: 276.10) (x2: 321.75 y2: 325.12),"2(1)  6.84, p  .011","chi-square(1) = 6.84, p = .011",2,4377,(x1: 484.98 y1: 307.31) (x2: 321.75 y2: 325.12),Tom Gordon-Hecker,tomgo@post.bgu.ac.il,1,kqmnz

(2) To what degree does product development teams' use of micropolitical strategies help reduce resistance and get approval with minimum compromise in the product? (3) To what extent do some of these micropolitical strategies harm the new product's performance? The findings suggest that products with both market and technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development. If the product development team wants to reduce resistance to products with market newness, it needs to build a coalition of supporters that can help it during the review process. Similarly, if the team seeks to minimize resistance to products with technology newness, it should frame the product in terms of the firms' existing products, strategies, and competitive thrusts. However, such framing increases resistance to market newness. If products continue to be resisted, they must be compromised (i.e., modified as a concession) to win approval. If the team wants to reduce the degree of compromise, it should initially develop the product in hiding. Products that are compromised perform poorly in the marketplace.","[Sethi, Rajesh; Sethi, Anju] Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA; [Iqbal, Zafar] Depaul Univ, Dept Mkt, Chicago, IL 60604 USA","Sethi, R (reprint author), Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Potsdam, NY 13676 USA.",sethir@clarkson.edu; ziqbal@depaul.edu; sethia@clarkson.edu,,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA",0022-2429,1547-7185,2012,76,2,10.1509/jm.09.0308,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000300653000007,99-115,Sethi,Rajesh,12-Mar,Sethi_JournMarket_2012_q47dk.pdf,The findings suggest that products with | technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development.,The findings suggest that products with | technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development.,0,1 | 1,583 | 639,(x1: 190.33 y1: 212.49) (x2: 376.66 y2: 220.51) | (x1: 464.82 y1: 212.49) (x2: 321.36 y2: 231.51),"The greater the technology newness of the new product, the greater is the review committee’s resistance to the product.","The greater the technology newness of the new product, the greater is the review committee’s resistance to the product.",0,5,196,(x1: 83.75 y1: 86.49) (x2: 113.49 y2: 114.54),"technology newness is positively related to resistance (b = .22, t = 2.29, p < .01)","…technology newness is positively related to resistance (b = .22, t = 2.29, p < .01).",0,10,3580,(x1: 391.18 y1: 151.93) (x2: 475.02 y2: 171.94),"b = .22, t = 2.29, p < .01","b = .22, t = 2.29, p < .01",10,3636,(x1: 373.72 y1: 163.44) (x2: 471.69 y2: 171.94),Rajesh Sethi,sethir@clarkson.edu,1,v4rdl

In the research reported here, we demonstrated a striking effect, wherein items that have just been the focus of reflective attention (internal attention to an active representation) also are inhibited. Participants saw two items, followed by a cue to think back to (i.e., refresh, or direct reflective attention toward) one item, and then had to identify either the refreshed item, the unrefreshed item, or a novel item. Responses were significantly slower for refreshed items than for unrefreshed items, although refreshed items were better remembered on a later memory test. Control experiments in which we replaced the refresh event with a second presentation of one of the words did not show similar effects.

Third, they present a study designed to illustrate how single-neuron studies are conducted and how data from them are processed and analyzed. This study examines people's ability to upregulate (i.e., enhance) the emotion of fear, which has implications for designing effective fear appeals. The study shows that the firing rates of neurons previously shown to respond selectively to fearful content increased with emotion enhancement instructions, but only for a video that did not automatically evoke substantial fear.

Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context- free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines.","[Rooderkerk, Robert P.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Van Heerde, Harald J.] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Waikato, New Zealand; [Bijmolt, Tammo H.

The dominant perspective contends that benefits provide disincentive to work, whereas others portray benefits as job-search subsidies that facilitate better job matches. Despite many studies of welfare benefits and unemployment, the literature has neglected how this relationship might vary across institutional contexts. This article investigates how unemployment benefits and minimum income benefits affect unemployment across levels of the institutional insider/outsider divide. I analyze the moderating role of the disparity in employment protection for holders of permanent and temporary contracts and of the configuration of wage bargaining. The analysis combines data from 20 European countries and the United States using the European Union Labour Force Survey and the Current Population Survey 1992-2009. I use a pseudo-panel approach, including fixed effects for sociodemographic groups within countries and interactions between benefits and institutions. The results indicate that unemployment benefits and minimum income benefits successfully subsidize job search and reduce unemployment in labor markets with a moderate institutional insider/outsider divide. However, when there is greater disparity in employment protection and when bargaining either combines low unionization with high centralization or high unionization with low centralization, generous benefits create a disincentive to work, plausibly because attractive job opportunities are scarce.","[Biegert, Thomas] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany","Biegert, T (reprint author), WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",thomas.biegert@wzb.eu,German Research Foundation [EB 434/2-1],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2017,82,5,10.1177/0003122417727095,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000419152500006,1037-1064,Biegert,Thomas,17-Oct,Biegert_AmSocioRev_2017_890gn.pdf,The results indicate that unemployment benefits and minimum income benefits | reduce unemployment in labor markets with a moderate institutional insider/outsider divide.,The results indicate that unemployment benefits and minimum income benefits | reduce unemployment in labor markets with a moderate institutional insider/outsider divide.,0,1 | 1,2130 | 2244,(x1: 325.17 y1: 394.70) (x2: 278.51 y2: 411.01) | (x1: 51.49 y1: 416.70) (x2: 434.53 y2: 422.01),"First, it establishes the institutional insider/outsider divide as a mod- erator of the relationship between benefits and unemployment.","First, it establishes the institutional insider/outsider divide as a mod- erator of the relationship between benefits and unemployment.",0,22,2943,(x1: 342.93 y1: 308.40) (x2: 331.78 y2: 349.94),"Table 1 summarizes the results of five fixed- effects regression models of unemployment on welfare benefits, institutions determining the insider/outsider divide, and control vari- ables. | Model 2 introduces the two-way interac- tions between unemployment benefits and the EPL ratio | In summary, the findings support the prop- osition that the effect of welfare benefits on employment is moderated by the institutional insider/outsider divide","Table 1 summarizes the results of five fixed-effects regression models of unemployment on welfare benefits, institutions determining the insider/outsider divide, and control variables...Model 2 introduces the two-way interactions between unemployment benefits and the EPL ratio...In summary, the findings support the proposition that the effect of welfare benefits on employment is moderated by the institutional insider/outsider divide.

Using nationally representative data and three-level hierarchical linear models, this study explored the links between teacher perceptions and children's sociodemographic backgrounds. The authors find that teachers perceive substantial racial-ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender differences in children's literacy skills. Roughly half of these disparities are explained by actual between-group differences. The remaining perceptual inaccuracies flow more from classroom characteristics than from teachers' professional or personal backgrounds (e. g., their own race or ethnicity). Specifically, holding students' social and academic backgrounds constant, the authors find that teachers in lower-socioeconomic-status and lower-achieving contexts more often underestimate their students' abilities. These results highlight the importance of recent policy efforts to avoid isolating traditionally disadvantaged children.","[Ready, Douglas D.; Wright, David L.] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Polit & Educ Program, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ready, Douglas D.] Columbias Quantitat Methods Social Sci Program, New York, NY 10027 USA","Ready, DD (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Polit & Educ Program, 525 W 120th St,Box 67, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ddr2111@columbia.edu; dlw2104@columbia.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-8312,1935-1011,2011,48,2,10.3102/0002831210374874,Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research,WOS:000288598800004,335-360,Ready,Douglas D.,11-Apr,Ready_AmEduResJourn_2011_5x6pl.pdf,The authors find that teachers perceive sub- stantial racial-ethnic | differences in children’s literacy skills,The authors find that teachers perceive sub- stantial racial-ethnic | differences in children’s literacy skills,0,1 | 1,620 | 715,(x1: 205.28 y1: 334.21) (x2: 162.50 y2: 351.10) | (x1: 291.57 y1: 346.17) (x2: 128.68 y2: 363.01),Our results suggest that teachers perceive substantial differences in liter- acy ability across student sociodemographic subgroups,Our results suggest that teachers perceive substantial differences in liter- acy ability across student sociodemographic subgroups,0,20,881,(x1: 53.80 y1: 237.49) (x2: 282.39 y2: 254.38),Table 3 | Model 2 | The results also suggest | systematic underestimation of literacy skills among Black children,"The results also suggest…systematic underestimation of literacy skills among Black children…Table 3…Model 2.

But friendship is relational and contextual. Countries are more likely to act on particular common interests if few other actors share that identity. In contrast, new cleavages are likely to emerge as an identity becomes ubiquitous. The tendency for states to form alliances based on certain affinities is thus best thought of as a variable, rather than as a constant. For example, in systems where democracies are scarce, democracies eagerly co-ally. As democracy becomes common, however, incentives binding democratic allies together weaken compared to other definitions of mutual interest. This argument, and the evidence we provide, suggest that the salience of identities as cues to affinity and difference vary with the distribution of types in the system.","[Gartzke, Erik] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weisiger, Alex] Univ Penn, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Gartzke, E (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",egartzke@ucsd.edu; weisiger@sas.upenn.edu,,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0007-1234,1469-2112,2013,43,1,10.1017/s0007123412000208,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000312657500002,25-52,Gartzke,Erik,13-Jan,Gartzke_BritJournPoliSci_2013_2p235.pdf,"As democracy becomes common, however, incentives binding democratic allies together weaken compared to other definitions of mutual interest","As democracy becomes common, however, incentives binding democratic allies together weaken compared to other definitions of mutual interest",0,1,753,(x1: 391.69 y1: 227.72) (x2: 180.52 y2: 251.72),HYPOTHESIS 1 The probability of an alliance in democratic dyads declines as the system is more democratic.,HYPOTHESIS 1 The probability of an alliance in democratic dyads declines as the system is more democratic.,0,17,920,(x1: 77.84 y1: 210.68) (x2: 216.71 y2: 226.26),"results appear in Table 1 | adding the interaction term between dyadic and systemic democracy levels in Model 1.3 results in a dramatically different situation. | As anticipated, the effect of regime type on dyadic alliance choice is not fixed and exogenous, but instead evolves in response to the changing distribution of democracy at the system level","...results appear in Table 1...adding the interaction term between dyadic and systemic democracy levels in Model 1.3 results in a dramatically different situation...As anticipated, the effect of regime type on dyadic alliance choice is not fixed and exogenous, but instead evolves in response to the changing distribution of democracy at the system level.

The goal of this study was to evaluate whether relatives' observed appropriate and inappropriate emotional involvement (intrusiveness, self-sacrifice, and distress about patients' well-being) moderated the effectiveness of a family-based intervention for bipolar disorder. Method: 108 patients with bipolar disorder (mean age = 35.61 years, SD = 10.07; 57% female) and their relatives (62% spouses) from 2 clinical trials completed 10-min problem-solving interactions prior to being treated with pharmacotherapy plus family-based therapy (FBT) or brief psychoeducation (crisis management [CM]). Patients were interviewed every 3-6 months over 2 years to assess mood symptoms. Results: When relatives showed low levels of inappropriate self-sacrifice, CM and FBT were both associated with improvements in patients' manic symptoms over 2 years. When relatives showed high levels, patients in CM became more manic over time, whereas patients in FBT became less manic. Group differences in mania trajectories were also observed at high levels of inappropriate emotional response but not at low. When relatives showed high levels of appropriate self-sacrifice, patients in both groups became less depressed. At low levels of appropriate self-sacrifice, patients in CM did not improve, whereas patients in FBT became less depressed. Conclusions: Future studies of bipolar disorder should consider the prognostic value of the amount and appropriateness of relatives' emotional involvement with patients in addition to their critical behaviors.","[Fredman, Steffany J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Baucom, Donald H.; Boeding, Sara E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Miklowitz, David J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Fredman, SJ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, 315 HHD East, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sjf23@psu.edu,"National Institute of Mental Health [MH72124, MH43931, MH55101, MH62555, MH93676]; John D. and Catherine T.

Nevertheless, existing wartime and postwar public opinion research is largely confined to countries directly affected by conflict. As a result, current research may overlook important war-affected populations and processes shaping their opinions. I address this problem by examining the question: does incorporation in settlement countries reduce support for conflict ideology? Examining this question requires new microdata. I examine the results of a large-scale survey of ex-Yugoslavs in Sweden. The findings suggest that incorporation undermines support for conflict ideology by increasing the socioeconomic security and social identity complexity of migrants.

The present paper documents a quasi-experimental study where high school Earth science students completed these instructional scaffolds, including an explanation task scored for evaluative levels (erroneous, descriptive, relational, and critical), along with measures of plausibility reappraisal and knowledge. Repeated measures analyses of variance reveal significant increases in plausibility and knowledge scores for students completing instructional scaffolds that promoted students' evaluations about the connections between lines of evidence and two alternative explanations, whereas evaluations about connections between lines of evidence and only one alternative show no change in scores. A structural equation model suggests that students' evaluation may influence post instructional plausibility and knowledge. The results of this study demonstrate that students' active evaluation of scientific alternatives and explicit reappraisal of plausibility judgments can support deeper learning of Earth science content.","[Lombardi, Doug; Bailey, Janelle M.; Burrell, Shondricka] Temple Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Bickel, Elliot S.] George Washington Carver Engn & Sci High Sch, Philadelphia, PA USA","Lombardi, D (reprint author), 450 Ritter Hall,1301 Cecil B Moore Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",doug.lombardi@temple.edu,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1316057, DRL-1721041]",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0361-476X,1090-2384,2018,54,,10.1016/j.cedpsych.2018.06.008,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000442716200015,184-198,Lombardi,Doug,18-Jul,Lombardi_ContEduPsych_2018_5k56l.pdf,Repeated measures analyses of variance reveal significant in- creases in plausibility | scores for students completing instructional scaﬀolds that promoted stu- dents’ evaluations about the connections between lines of evidence and two alternative explanations,Repeated measures analyses of variance reveal significant in- creases in plausibility | scores for students completing instructional scaﬀolds that promoted stu- dents’ evaluations about the connections between lines of evidence and two alternative explanations,0,1 | 1,1210 | 1310,(x1: 360.06 y1: 344.38) (x2: 272.29 y2: 358.41) | (x1: 325.70 y1: 353.96) (x2: 527.05 y2: 367.94),we hypothesized that the MEL would be more eﬀective than the Mono-MEL in | facilitating plausibility reappraisal,we hypothesized that the MEL would be more eﬀective than the Mono-MEL in | facilitating plausibility reappraisal,0,4 | 4,5520 | 5598,(x1: 386.02 y1: 269.38) (x2: 416.93 y2: 284.76) | (x1: 436.87 y1: 279.81) (x2: 557.59 y2: 284.76),"The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between treatment and time for plausibility, Wilks’ λ = 0.843, F(2, 61) = 5.67, p = .006, with a medium eﬀect size (η2 = 0.157). | η2 = 0.157 | post instruction MEL plausi- bility scores (M= 1.76, SD= 1.42) were significantly greater than | post instruction Mono-MEL scores (M= 0.00, SD = 0.901)","The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between treatment and time for plausibility, Wilks’ lambda = 0.843, F(2, 61) = 5.67, p = .006, with a medium eﬀect size (eta squared = 0.157)...post instruction MEL plausibility scores (M = 1.76, SD = 1.42) were significantly greater than...post instruction Mono-MEL scores (M = 0.00, SD = 0.901)...",0,10 | 10 | 10 | 10,2013 | 2193 | 2629 | 2798,(x1: 241.90 y1: 375.63) (x2: 178.59 y2: 411.99) | (x1: 134.65 y1: 406.82) (x2: 173.38 y2: 411.99) | (x1: 457.40 y1: 60.19) (x2: 539.68 y2: 75.57) | (x1: 306.60 y1: 91.54) (x2: 533.20 y2: 96.49),"F(2, 61) = 5.67, p = .006","F(2, 61) = 5.67, p = .006 … eta squared = 0.157",10,2140,(x1: 196.33 y1: 396.57) (x2: 286.43 y2: 401.50),Doug Lombardi,doug.lombardi@temple.edu,1,7n16m

Lab-work learning environments in which students get direct (""hands-on"") experience with science content that is related to their everyday lives are posited to have positive effects on state/trait motivation and achievement, but there is a lack of sound empirical evidence to support this claim. In the present study, the effectiveness of a lab-work learning unit on the topic of ""the chemistry of starch"" was examined by applying a cluster randomized field study with three treatment conditions with lab-work elements and a control group. The first group was taught with lab work elements in School only, the second group (SCOL & school) was taught in a combined condition encompassing both a SCOL (Science Center Outreach Lab) visit and classroom learning, the third group was taught entirely outside the school environment (SCOL only), and the fourth group was a wait-list control group, which was not exposed to a ""starch"" curriculum at the time of this study. Data from 1854 students were gathered in 67 ninth-grade classes on state motivation during the intervention and on trait motivation and achievement at pretest, posttest, and follow-up. Multilevel regression analyses revealed several differences between the lab-work conditions and the control group: Whereas the hands-on practical approach effectively enhanced state motivation with positive effects on joy, situational interest, situational competence, and reduced boredom in all three treatment conditions (School only, SCOL & school, and SCOL only), there were differences in trait effects: learning at school (School only and SCOL & school) increased achievement (posttest and follow-up), whereas the SCOL visit resulted in a small and spurious increase in trait motivation (reduced cost and increased competence beliefs only on the posttest).

The current study tested this hypothesis by proposing that college students' preexisting efficacy beliefs may affect how physiological arousal during exams is construed as a valence of positive emotion. Survey data were collected from 172 students in a statistics course at a large research university in the Midwest. Students provided self-reported intensity of autonomic arousal during previous exams, statistics self-efficacy, and positive affect toward a proximal final exam. The construal bias hypothesis was supported by a significant interaction between autonomic arousal and self-efficacy on the dependent variable positive affect. Results revealed that as autonomic arousal increased, so did the moderating effect of self-efficacy. Specifically, as physiological arousal intensified, students with high or low self-efficacy reported divergent levels of positive emotion.

Yet, despite comprising more than one-eighth of the US population, people with disabilities are seldom integrated into sociological studies of inequality. This study uses time use as a lens through which to understand one type of inequality between working-aged people with and without disabilities: participation in daily activities. It also tests whether social disparities (as suggested by the social model of disability) or health disparities (as suggested by the medical model of disability) explain a larger percentage of participation differences. I first consider if disability predicts daily time in market work, nonmarket work, tertiary (health-related) activities, and leisure-net of health and sociodemographic characteristics. Next, I utilize Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess the relative contribution of these characteristics in explaining time differences. Results from the American Time Use Survey indicate that adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without disabilities in market work and more time in tertiary activities and leisure. There is no difference in nonmarket time. Health accounts for the largest percentage of the explained component of tertiary time differences, but depending on the choice of predictors, sociodemographic characteristics account for as much-or more-of the explained component of differences in market and leisure time. Results indicate the importance of disentangling disability from health in sociological studies of inequality. They also support a hybrid disability model in suggesting that both health and sociodemographic characteristics determine how disability shapes daily life.","[Shandra, Carrie L.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sociol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Shandra, CL (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Sociol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",,US Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Disability Research Consortium,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,2018,97,1,10.1093/sf/soy031,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000443579600020,157-191,Shandra,Carrie L.,18-Sep,Shandra_SocialForces_2018_xrb79.pdf,Results from the American Time Use Survey indi- cate that adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without disabilities in market work,Results from the American Time Use Survey indi- cate that adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without disabilities in market work,0,1,1703,(x1: 199.85 y1: 301.59) (x2: 103.90 y2: 331.72),disability independently associates with the market | time of working-aged men,disability independently associates with the market | time of working-aged men,0,24 | 24,338 | 413,(x1: 210.11 y1: 106.65) (x2: 82.96 y2: 124.45) | (x1: 178.25 y1: 118.67) (x2: 293.99 y2: 124.45),"Table 1 presents weighted estimates of mean minutes in market work | by | presence of any dis- ability. | Results indicate significant differences in time use for men and women in all activity domains except non- market work.

This study empirically evaluates these arguments as they relate specifically to aggregate classes defined in terms of workplace ownership and authority relations, which are conceived to be distinct from both aggregate and disaggregate occupational classes based on the technical division of labor. A number of findings suggest that both the death and decomposition of class perspectives are in need of reconsideration or refinement. First, aggregate classes based on workplace ownership and authority cannot be conveniently disaggregated into smaller occupational classes based on the technical division of labor. Second, aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and political attitudes are statistically significant and substantively large across a wide variety of measures, and these differences are present even within disaggregate occupational classes. Third, aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and political attitudes show no evidence of declining since the 1970s. In fact, the only significant evidence of temporal change suggests a considerable increase in income inequality between positions in the workplace ownership and authority structure. The implications of these findings for class-analytic theory and research are discussed.","[Wodtke, Geoffrey T.] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S SJ4, Canada","Wodtke, GT (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S SJ4, Canada.",geoffrey.wodtke@utoronto.ca,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,2017,95,4,10.1093/sf/sox012,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000401773700050,1479-1508,Wodtke,Geoffrey T.,17-Jun,Wodtke_SocialForces_2017_gr5bn.pdf,the only significant evidence of temporal change suggests a considerable increase in income inequality between positions in the workplace ownership and authority structure.,the only significant evidence of temporal change suggests a considerable increase in income inequality between positions in the workplace ownership and authority structure.,0,1,1992,(x1: 318.85 y1: 356.81) (x2: 342.45 y2: 386.99),"the only evidence of an appreciable change during this period indicates that aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in equivalized household income grew substantially larger, particularly from the 1980s onward.","the only evidence of an appreciable change during this period indicates that aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in equivalized household income grew substantially larger, particularly from the 1980s onward.",0,20,0,(x1: 35.89 y1: 58.68) (x2: 334.31 y2: 88.45),"Table 1 presents results from a set of formal hypothesis tests used to evaluate whether aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions have changed since the 1970s. | For the measure of equivalized household income, however, Wald tests suggest that aggregate class differences have changed significantly over time","Table 1 presents results from a set of formal hypothesis tests used to evaluate whether aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions have changed since the 1970s...For the measure of equivalized household income, however, Wald tests suggest that aggregate class differences have changed significantly over time.

The findings support the imagination principle, which states that people learn more deeply when prompted to form images depicting the spatial arrangement of what they are reading.","[Leopold, Claudia] Univ Munster, Inst Psychol Educ, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Leopold, C (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Psychol Educ, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",claudia.leopold@psy.uni-muenster.de,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-0663,1939-2176,2015,107,1,10.1037/a0037142,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000349633500005,47-63,Leopold,Claudia,15-Feb,Leopold_JournEduPsych_2015_d603v.pdf,Imagery prompts facilitated transfer | performance compared to a control group on an immediate test,Imagery prompts facilitated transfer | performance compared to a control group on an immediate test,0,1 | 1,810 | 861,(x1: 300.23 y1: 235.54) (x2: 418.84 y2: 240.00) | (x1: 129.00 y1: 245.54) (x2: 330.76 y2: 250.00),we predicted that students who were asked to imagine corresponding graphics as they read an explanative science text would score higher on subsequent transfer tests than students who simply read the text (Prediction 1),we predicted that students who were asked to imagine corresponding graphics as they read an explanative science text would score higher on subsequent transfer tests than students who simply read the text (Prediction 1),0,3,6457,(x1: 452.95 y1: 572.96) (x2: 512.75 y2: 610.98),"An analysis of variance conducted on these data demonstrated a significant effect of treatment, F(3, 81)  4.70, MSE  15.30, p  .004,  2  .15.","An analysis of variance conducted on these data demonstrated a significant effect of treatment, F(3, 81) = 4.70, MSE = 15.30, p = .004, eta-squared = .15.

To inform theories of multimedia learning that guide the design of educational materials, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of spoken-only, written-only, and spoken-written presentations on learning retention and transfer. After an extensive search for experimental studies meeting specified inclusion criteria, data from 57 independent studies were extracted. Most of the research participants were postsecondary students. Overall, this mesa-analysis revealed that outcomes comparing spoken-written and written-only presentations did not differ, but students who learned from spoken-written presentations outperformed those who learned from spoken-only presentations. This effect was dependent on learners' prior knowledge, pacing of presentation, and inclusion of animation or diagrams. Specifically, the advantages of spoken-written presentations over spoken-only presentations were found for low prior knowledge learners, system-paced learning materials, and picture-free materials. In comparison with verbatim, spoken-written presentations, presentations displaying key terms extracted from spoken narrations were associated with better learning outcomes and accounted for much of the advantage of spoken-written over spoken-only presentations. These findings have significant implications for the design of multimedia materials.","[Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Counseling Psychol, Coll Educ, Educ Psychol Program, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Nesbit, John C.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Adesope, OO (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Counseling Psychol, Coll Educ, Educ Psychol Program, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",olusola.adesope@wsu.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-0663,1939-2176,2012,104,1,10.1037/a0026147,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000300136700017,250-263,Adesope,Olusola O.,12-Feb,Adesope_JournEduPsych_2012_0pmzv.pdf,the advantages of spoken–written presentations over spoken-only presentations were found for low prior knowledge learners,the advantages of spoken–written presentations over spoken-only presentations were found for low prior knowledge learners,0,1,1093,(x1: 299.79 y1: 262.54) (x2: 348.12 y2: 277.00),we predicted that low prior knowledge students would learn more from verbally redundant materials than would those with high prior knowledge,we predicted that low prior knowledge students would learn more from verbally redundant materials than would those with high prior knowledge,0,2,5704,(x1: 440.42 y1: 572.98) (x2: 505.17 y2: 600.00),"Table 4 presents analyses of participants’ | prior domain knowledge as moderator variables. | The studies with low prior knowledge learners were associated with a statistically detectable effect size (g  0.29) | studies conducted with low prior knowledge learners found advantages for spoken– written presentations (g  0.29), while studies with high prior knowledge learners did not (g   0.05).","Table 4 presents analyses of participants’…prior domain knowledge as moderator variables…The studies with low prior knowledge learners were associated with a statistically detectable effect size (g = 0.29)...[Table 4, Prior domain knowledge, Low, k = 25; g+ = 0.29, SE = 0.05; 95% CI = [0.18, 0.39]; p < .05]",0,7 | 7 | 8 | 10,2496 | 2579 | 380 | 3229,(x1: 338.94 y1: 528.97) (x2: 499.87 y2: 533.99) | (x1: 406.27 y1: 539.97) (x2: 340.74 y2: 555.99) | (x1: 121.08 y1: 409.48) (x2: 66.75 y2: 436.50) | (x1: 480.15 y1: 513.46) (x2: 458.43 y2: 551.48),"Table 4 | k | 95% CI | g | SE | Prior domain knowledge | Low | 25 | 0.29 | 0.05 | [0.18, 0.39]","Table 4, Prior domain knowledge, Low, k = 25; g+ = 0.29, SE = 0.05; 95% CI = [0.18, 0.39]; p < .05",8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8,1753,(x1: 48.00 y1: 77.97) (x2: 75.98 y2: 82.99) | (x1: 228.80 y1: 126.60) (x2: 232.35 y2: 131.00) | (x1: 381.10 y1: 126.54) (x2: 406.42 y2: 131.00) | (x1: 274.25 y1: 126.60) (x2: 278.25 y2: 131.00) | (x1: 327.14 y1: 126.60) (x2: 336.03 y2: 131.00) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 243.04) (x2: 128.42 y2: 247.50) | (x1: 56.00 y1: 252.04) (x2: 70.67 y2: 256.50) | (x1: 226.57 y1: 252.04) (x2: 234.57 y2: 256.50) | (x1: 274.41 y1: 252.04) (x2: 288.41 y2: 256.50) | (x1: 324.59 y1: 252.04) (x2: 338.59 y2: 256.50) | (x1: 371.26 y1: 252.04) (x2: 408.59 y2: 256.50),Olusola O.

In this article, partner effects on promotions to top positions are investigated. Discrete time event history analysis is performed on data from the Panel Study of Belgian Households (PSBH, 1994-2001). Two types of partner effects are analysed: the effect of having a partner and the effect of certain characteristics of the partner. The data do not provide evidence for effects of merely having a partner. With regard to partner characteristics, it is confirmed that positive partner effects dominate, both for labour market and for financial resources. These results can be explained by social capital theory: resources of the partner stimulate the personal social capital and therefore also the personal career. Therefore, it is stated that being in a dual-career couple is in the interest of both partners' individual careers. On the other hand, a negative effect of the number of working hours of the male partner on women's promotion probabilities is found. It is concluded that, in order to break through the glass ceiling, women benefit from their partner's resources but that they also need the opportunity and, more specifically, the time to do so.","[Baerts, Anneleen] Vrije Univ Brussel, Sociol Dept SOCI, Res Grp TOR, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Deschacht, Nick; Guerry, Marie-Anne] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Math Operat Res Stat & Informat Syst Managem, Res Grp MAPO, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Baerts, A (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Sociol Dept SOCI, Res Grp TOR, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",anneleen.baerts@vub.ac.be; nick.deschacht@vub.ac.be; marie-anne.guerry@vub.ac.be,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2011,27,5,10.1093/esr/jcq030,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000295418400007,654-668,Baerts,Anneleen,11-Oct,Baerts_EurSocioRev_2011_xr5gb.pdf,"With regard to partner characteristics, it is confirmed that positive partner effects dominate | for labour market | resources","With regard to partner characteristics, it is confirmed that positive partner effects dominate | for labour market | resources",0,1 | 1 | 1,650 | 751 | 787,(x1: 413.96 y1: 272.09) (x2: 434.47 y2: 288.56) | (x1: 463.79 y1: 283.99) (x2: 156.62 y2: 300.53) | (x1: 233.97 y1: 295.96) (x2: 272.42 y2: 300.53),Labour market resources of the partner have a positive effect on the probability to experience a promo- tion to a top position for | women,Labour market resources of the partner have a positive effect on the probability to experience a promo- tion to a top position for | women,0,5 | 5,294 | 433,(x1: 73.42 y1: 131.29) (x2: 151.84 y2: 158.11) | (x1: 195.02 y1: 153.68) (x2: 220.03 y2: 158.11),"Table 4 | in Model 3, the duration since labour market entry | are added.

Against this background, we developed a computer-based training intervention in the domain of ecology to foster precursors of evaluativist epistemological understanding and intellectual values as well as conceptual knowledge about epistemological understanding and intellectual values. We tested the training intervention in a control-group experimental design at two points of time: immediately after the intervention and one week later. Participants were 66 German high school students (35 female; mean age = 18.21). We found positive effects of our training intervention on epistemic orientation, intellectual values, and conceptual knowledge that were (still) observable after one week. Overall, the present computer-based training intervention can be regarded as a promising first step on the way to fostering important prerequisites of the will to engage in argumentative thinking.

However, research in the field of Interactive Learning Environments shows that learners needing assistance do not systematically seek or use help, even when it is available. The aim of the present study is to explore the role of some factors from research in Interactive Learning Environments in another situation: using a new technology not as a means of acquiring knowledge but to realize a specific task. Firstly, we present the three factors included in this study (1) the role of the content of assistance, namely operative vs. function-oriented help; (2) the role of the user’s prior knowledge; (3) the role of the trigger of assistance, i.e. help provided after the user’s request vs. help provided by the system. In this latter case, it is necessary to detect the user’s difficulties. On the basis of research on problem-solving, we list behavioral criteria expressing the user’s difficulties. Then, we present two experiments that use “real” technologies developed by a large company and tested by “real” users. The results showed that (1) even when participants had reached an impasse, most of them never sought assistance, (2) operative assistance that was automatically provided by the system was effective for novice users, and (3) function-oriented help that was automatically provided by the system was effective for expert users.

Particularly, how much value customers contribute to the brand value co-creation process remains unclear. This research develops in a series of eight studies the Customer Co-Creation Value (CCCV) measurement scale that helps firms assess the value of customers in the brand value co-creation process. The findings reveal that CCCV is a multidimensional construct consisting of two higher-order factors and seven dimensions: customer-owned resources (including brand knowledge, brand skills, brand creativity, and brand connectedness) and customer motivation (comprising brand passion, brand trust, and brand commitment). Further, the CCCV scale reliably and validly gauges the value customers contribute to a firm's brand. The CCCV framework helps marketing managers understand how customers can contribute to a firm's brand value co-creation efforts and how much value customers contribute to a brand in the co-creation process.","[Merz, Michael A.] San Jose State Univ, Lucas Coll Business, Dept Mkt & Decis Sci, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Zarantonello, Lia] Univ Roehampton, Business Sch, London SW15 5PU, England; [Grappi, Silvia] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ Marco Biagi, Virile Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy","Zarantonello, L (reprint author), Univ Roehampton, Business Sch, London SW15 5PU, England.",michael.merz@sjsu.edu; lia.zarantonello@roehampton.ac.uk; silvia.grappi@unimore.it,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0148-2963,1873-7978,2018,82,,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.08.018,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000414881400008,79-89,Merz,Michael A.,18-Jan,Merz_JournBusRes_2018_v5b8p.pdf,the CCCV scale reliably and validly gauges the value customers contribute to a firm's brand.,the CCCV scale reliably and validly gauges the value customers contribute to a firm's brand.,0,1,1592,(x1: 230.91 y1: 362.52) (x2: 523.23 y2: 366.97),this research shows that CCCV is positively related to actual brand value co-creation,this research shows that CCCV is positively related to actual brand value co-creation,0,10,469,(x1: 78.63 y1: 133.38) (x2: 124.74 y2: 148.82),"Results show that CCCV is a significant predictor of all actual behaviors, except for the number of groups with which the users share an association and the number of photos posted over the specified one week time period (see Fig. 2, Panel A).

This article traces a portion of the rise of racial inequality in incarceration in northern and southern states to increasing rates of African-American migration to the North between 1880 and 1950. It employs three analytical strategies. First, it introduces a decomposition to assess the relative contributions of geographic shifts in the population and regional changes in the incarceration rate to the increase in racial disparity. Second, it estimates the effect of the rate of white and nonwhite migration on the change in the white and nonwhite incarceration rates of the North. Finally, it uses macro- and microdata to evaluate the mechanisms proposed to explain this effect.","Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Muller, C (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, 436 William James Hall,33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",muller@fas.harvard.edu,,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,1537-5390,2012,118,2,10.1086/666384,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000310352800001,281-326,Muller,Christopher,12-Sep,Muller_AmJournSocio_2012_1n79p.pdf,This article traces a portion of the rise of racial inequality in incarceration in northern and southern states to increasing rates of African-American migration to the North between 1880 and 1950.,This article traces a portion of the rise of racial inequality in incarceration in northern and southern states to increasing rates of African-American migration to the North between 1880 and 1950.,0,1,434,(x1: 136.24 y1: 266.22) (x2: 376.58 y2: 293.44),"The history of the sequential migration of Europeans and African- Americans into the northern United States yields three predictions re- garding racial disparity in incarceration.

We present findings using three different analytical techniques: random coefficient modeling (RCM), relative weight analysis (RWA), and polynomial regression (PR). RCM findings suggest that self-, direct report, peer, and supervisor ratings of leader behaviors differ and are associated with career derailment potential. RWA results indicate that self-ratings matter the least, whereas peer ratings of leader behaviors typically matter the most in predicting career derailment potential. PR analyses indicate that career derailment potential is lowest when self-ratings are lower than other ratings of leader behaviors and/or when self-other ratings converge on higher, rather than lower, ratings of leader behaviors.

Intelligence, working memory, processing speed, and in-class attention were assessed in 2 or more grades, and mathematical cognition was assessed with experimental tasks in all grades. The MLD group was characterized by low school-entry mathematics achievement and poor word reading skills. The former was mediated by poor fluency in processing or accessing quantities associated with small sets of objects and corresponding Arabic numerals, whereas the latter was mediated by slow automatized naming of letters and numbers. Both the MLD and LA groups showed slow across-grade growth in mathematics achievement. Group differences in growth were mediated by deficits or delays in fluency of number processing, the ability to retrieve basic facts from long-term memory and to decompose numbers to aid in problem solving, and by the central executive component of working memory and in-class attention.","[Geary, David C.; Hoard, Mary K.; Nugent, Lara; Bailey, Drew H.] Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Geary, DC (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",GearyD@Missouri.edu,"NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD045914, R37 HD045914]",AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-0663,1939-2176,2012,104,1,10.1037/a0025398,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000300136700014,206-223,Geary,David C.,12-Feb,Geary_JournEduPsych_2012_z08x6.pdf,The MLD group was characterized by low school-entry mathematics achievement and poor word reading skills.,The MLD group was characterized by low school-entry mathematics achievement and poor word reading skills.,0,1,623,(x1: 399.33 y1: 216.54) (x2: 412.41 y2: 231.00),Our results also confirm that children with MLD are typically poor readers,Our results also confirm that children with MLD are typically poor readers,0,12,6742,(x1: 532.06 y1: 671.97) (x2: 331.98 y2: 698.99),Word reading scores are also plotted in Figure 1 (Panel B) | LA group | had significantly higher intercepts than the MLD group (ps  .0001) | ps  .0001,Word reading scores are also plotted in Figure 1 (Panel B)...

In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.","[Khanna, Poonam] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Jones, Carla D.] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Boivie, Steven] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Khanna, P (reprint author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Management, 701 West St, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",pkhanna@uta.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0149-2063,1557-1211,2014,40,2,10.1177/0149206313515523,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Business & Economics; Psychology,WOS:000336214300009,557-585,Khanna,Poonam,14-Feb,Khanna_JournManage_2014_8gbzy.pdf,we find that the benefit of directors’ human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments.,we find that the benefit of directors’ human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments.,0,1,1135,(x1: 364.48 y1: 402.68) (x2: 236.26 y2: 429.65),"Hypothesis 2: The greater the level of information processing demands on directors, the lower the focal firm’s subsequent performance.","Hypothesis 2: The greater the level of information processing demands on directors, the lower the focal firm’s subsequent performance.",0,9,1998,(x1: 62.00 y1: 351.95) (x2: 207.96 y2: 367.93),"Table 2 presents the results of the GLS analyses. | Hypothesis 2 predicted that directors would be less effective at monitoring and providing advice to the focal firm’s management to the extent that they faced high levels of information processing demands at their other board appointments. | as Models 2 | show, this hypothesis was generally supported.

Despite the prevalence of this research, it is still unclear which psychological mechanism underlies the immediate reaction to cues of ostracism. According to the social-physical pain overlap theory, cues to ostracism induce a social pain response akin to physical pain due to shared neurological substrates between social and physical pain. Alternatively, it is possible that the immediate reaction to ostracism reflects a conflict detection mechanism responding to a violation of the expectation that one should be socially included. In the present studies, we used pupillometry to distinguish the immediate reaction to ostracism in terms of it primarily representing a pain-oriented response or a conflict-detection response. We continuously measured the pupillary reaction during games of Cyberball, which contained social inclusion events (a ball thrown to the participant) and exclusion events (a ball thrown to another player). We find that participants show a diininished pupillary reaction to cues of exclusion but not to cues of inclusion, consistent with the social-physical pain overlap theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Throughout five studies we find that a scientific deterministic worldview reduces opposition toward paternalist policies, independent of the putative influence of political ideology.

Copycats typically operate in the core product category of the imitated brand under the assumption that such ""in-category imitation"" is most effective. In contrast, four experiments demonstrate the benefits of ""out-of-category imitation"" for copycats, and the harmful effect on the imitated brand. Copycats are evaluated more positively in a related category, because consumers appraise the similarity between copycat and imitated brand more positively than in the core category, independent of the perceived similarity itself. This is due to a reduced salience of norms regarding imitation in the related category. Moreover, the results show a damaging backlash effect of out-of-category imitation on the general evaluation of the imitated brand and on its key perceived product attributes. The findings replicate across student, MTurk, and representative consumer samples; multiple product categories; and forms of brand imitation. This research demonstrates that out-of-category brand imitation helps copycat brands and hurts national leading brands much more than has so far been considered, which has managerial and public policy implications.","[van Horen, Femke] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Mkt, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pieters, Rik] Tilburg Univ, Mkt, Warandelaan 2, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands","van Horen, F (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Mkt, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",femke.van.horen@vu.nl; f.g.m.pieters@uvt.nl,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2017,44,4,10.1093/jcr/ucx065,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000416481300007,816-832,van Horen,Femke,17-Dec,van Horen_JournConsRes_2017_j9010.pdf,Copycats are evaluated more positively in a related category,Copycats are evaluated more positively in a related category,0,1,527,(x1: 261.75 y1: 301.68) (x2: 473.35 y2: 305.63),"Counter to the idea that transfer of positive associations is highest when a copycat brand is positioned in the same product category as the imitated brand, we hypothesize that copycats are evaluated more positively when positioned in a related yet different cate- gory than in the core category of the imitated brand (hy- pothesis 1).","Counter to the idea that transfer of positive associations is highest when a copycat brand is positioned in the same product category as the imitated brand, we hypothesize that copycats are evaluated more positively when positioned in a related yet different cate- gory than in the core category of the imitated brand (hy- pothesis 1).",0,3,3879,(x1: 416.02 y1: 278.10) (x2: 357.28 y2: 351.79),"Simple-effect tests showed, as predicted, that the copycat name Vabello was evaluated more negatively in the core category lip balm (M ¼ 2.55, SD¼ 1.21) than in the related category hand cream (M ¼ 4.01, SD¼ 1.11; F(1, 167) ¼ 30.08, p < .001,

Multiple experiments provide support for this perspective along with evidence for the process via both moderation and mediation. This works contributes to the consumer switching literature by demonstrating power as a new psychological catalyst for switching behavior. This work also adds to the power literature by distinguishing between goal priming and semantic priming accounts of the action orientation of high power. Specifically, consistent with a goal priming account, engaging in action is found to sate consumers subsequent need for action as opposed to maintain or increase consumers desire to act, as might be predicted from a semantic priming account.","[Jiang, Yuwei; Zhan, Lingjing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rucker, Derek D.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Jiang, YW (reprint author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuwei.jiang@polyu.edu.hk; lingjing.zhan@polyu.edu.hk; d-rucker@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2014,41,1,10.1086/675723,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000336798600013,183-196,Jiang,Yuwei,14-Jun,Jiang_JournConsRes_2014_q0p2d.pdf,"Because high power is associated with a readiness to act, and switching behavior often requires taking action in some form, inducing consumers to feel powerful is hypothesized to increase consumer switching","Because high power is associated with a readiness to act, and switching behavior often requires taking action in some form, inducing consumers to feel powerful is hypothesized to increase consumer switching",0,1,413,(x1: 506.79 y1: 246.40) (x2: 380.23 y2: 277.91),States of high power will prompt consumers to be more inclined to switch products or brands than states of low power.,States of high power will prompt consumers to be more inclined to switch products or brands than states of low power.,0,3,3665,(x1: 357.18 y1: 194.34) (x2: 439.20 y2: 221.82),"Consistent with our theorizing, participants in the high- power condition showed a higher degree of brand switching than those in the low-power condition.

We investigate this question by identifying 2 distinct types of daily work planning to explain why and when planning improves employees' daily performance. The first type is time management planning (TMP)-creating task lists, prioritizing tasks, and determining how and when to perform them. We propose that TMP enhances employees' performance by increasing their work engagement, but that these positive effects are weakened when employees face many interruptions in their day. The second type is contingent planning (CP) in which employees anticipate possible interruptions in their work and plan for them. We propose that CP helps employees stay engaged and perform well despite frequent interruptions. We investigate these hypotheses using a 2-week experience-sampling study. Our findings indicate that TMP's positive effects are conditioned upon the amount of interruptions, but CP has positive effects that are not influenced by the level of interruptions. Through this study, we help inform workers of the different planning methods they can use to increase their daily motivation and performance in dynamic work environments.","[Parke, Michael R.] London Business Sch, Dept Org Behav, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England; [Weinhardt, Justin M.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Dept Org Behav & Human Resource Management, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Brodsky, Andrew] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tangirala, Subrahmaniam] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [DeVoe, Sanford E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Dept Management & Org, Los Angeles, CA USA","Parke, MR (reprint author), London Business Sch, Dept Org Behav, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",mparke@london.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0021-9010,1939-1854,2018,103,3,10.1037/apl0000278,"Psychology, Applied; Management",Psychology; Business & Economics,WOS:000427606800005,300-312,Parke,Michael R.,18-Mar,Parke_JournAppPsych_2018_qvdyk.pdf,time management planning (TMP)— | enhances employees’ performance,time management planning (TMP)— | enhances employees’ performance,0,1 | 1,648 | 786,(x1: 377.84 y1: 280.54) (x2: 158.78 y2: 295.00) | (x1: 188.39 y1: 300.54) (x2: 298.76 y2: 305.00),Hypothesis 1 (H1): TMP positively relates to daily perfor- mance,Hypothesis 1 (H1): TMP positively relates to daily perfor- mance,0,3,4521,(x1: 322.01 y1: 265.49) (x2: 345.50 y2: 281.53),TMP had a direct effect on performance (  .08 [SE  .02]; p  .001),"…TMP had a direct effect on performance (gamma = .08, [SE = .02]; p < .001)…",0,7,211,(x1: 138.53 y1: 286.98) (x2: 168.19 y2: 303.00),.08 [SE  .02]; p  .001,gamma = .08 [SE = .02]; p < .001,7,253,(x1: 69.86 y1: 297.98) (x2: 165.19 y2: 303.00),Michael R Parke,mparke@london.edu,1,2b14z

First, the push-pull model proposes that there is a quadratic or curvilinear relationship existing between these 2 variables. Second, the unfolding model of turnover posits that turnover is a dynamic process and that a downward performance change may increase the likelihood of organizational separation. Drawing on decision theory, we propose and test an integrative framework. This approach incorporates both of these earlier models. Specifically, we argue that individuals are most likely to voluntarily exit when they are below-average performers who are also experiencing a downward performance change.

The authors utilized a role composition approach, which investigates how the characteristics of a set of role holders impact team effectiveness, to develop a theory of the strategic core of team's. Their theory suggests that certain team roles are most important for team performance and that the characteristics of the role holders in the ""core"" of the team are more important for overall team performance. This theory was tested in 778 teams drawn from 29 years of major league baseball (1974-2002). Results demonstrate that although high levels of experience and job-related skill,ire important predictors of team performance, the relationships between these constructs and team performance are significantly stronger when the characteristics are possessed by core role holders (as opposed to non-core role holders). Further. teams that invest more of their financial resources in these core roles are able to leverage such investments into significantly improved performance. These results have implications for team composition models, as they suggest a new method for considering individual contributions to a team's success that shifts the focus onto core roles.","[Humphrey, Stephen E.] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, Dept Management & Org, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Morgeson, Frederick P.] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Grad Sch Management, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Mannor, Michael J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Management, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Humphrey, SE (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, Dept Management & Org, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",stephen.humphrey@psu.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0021-9010,1939-1854,2009,94,1,10.1037/a0012997,"Psychology, Applied; Management",Psychology; Business & Economics,WOS:000262740300005,48-61,Humphrey,Stephen E.,9-Jan,Humphrey_JournAppPsych_2009_jw58w.pdf,"Results demonstrate that although high levels of experience and job-related skill are important predictors of team performance, the relationships between these constructs and team performance are significantly stronger when the characteristics are possessed by core role holders (as opposed to non-core role holders)","Results demonstrate that although high levels of experience and job-related skill are important predictors of team performance, the relationships between these constructs and team performance are significantly stronger when the characteristics are possessed by core role holders (as opposed to non-core role holders)",0,1,931,(x1: 269.50 y1: 280.64) (x2: 235.45 y2: 315.10),Hypothesis 1A: Teams with higher levels of career experience will have higher levels of overall team performance.,Hypothesis 1A: Teams with higher levels of career experience will have higher levels of overall team performance.,0,4,6330,(x1: 324.68 y1: 662.15) (x2: 518.34 y2: 678.09),"ca- reer experience (  .452,  R2  .22, p  .05) | independently influenced team performance, which supported Hypotheses 1A","career experience (beta = .452, delta R^2 = .22, p < .05)...independently influenced team performance, which supports Hypotheses 1A...",0,8 | 8,3963 | 4059,(x1: 535.76 y1: 371.08) (x2: 488.26 y2: 387.11) | (x1: 454.15 y1: 393.09) (x2: 493.38 y2: 409.10),".452,  R2  .22, p  .05","beta = .452, delta R^2 = .22, p < .05",8,3986,(x1: 388.59 y1: 382.08) (x2: 485.26 y2: 387.11),Stephen E.

This study examines how R&D's level of power, relative to marketing's, affects product program newness and meaningfulness, and thus market and financial performance. Relying on the motive of enhancement, this study reveals two underlying mechanisms to explain considerations of R&D and marketing depending on R&D's power. A multi-informant sample of top executives and subordinates from 229 firms indicates distinct effects of R&D's relative power on product program newness and meaningfulness. Specifically, R&D power exhibits a positive linear relationship with product program newness but a nonlinear effect with meaningfulness. To expand market and financial performance, firms should seek to generate meaningful product innovations through a moderate level of relative R&D power, particularly when their environments are characterized by high competitive intensity.","[Stock, Ruth Maria; Reiferscheid, Ines] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Mkt & Human Resource Management, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany","Stock, RM (reprint author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Mkt & Human Resource Management, Hochschulstr 1, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany.",rsh@stock-homburg.de; ines.reiferscheid@stock-homburg.de,,SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0092-0703,1552-7824,2014,42,3,10.1007/s11747-013-0354-5,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000334577700003,264-276,Stock,Ruth Maria,14-May,Stock_JournAcaMarkSci_2014_qdm6d.pdf,R&D power exhibits a positive linear relation- ship with product program newness,R&D power exhibits a positive linear relation- ship with product program newness,0,1,1020,(x1: 103.38 y1: 440.72) (x2: 197.97 y2: 458.52),we note that the positive linear effect of relative R&D power on product program newness indicates that the reservations of the marketing department about sharing information with R&D cannot regulate the newness of the product program,we note that the positive linear effect of relative R&D power on product program newness indicates that the reservations of the marketing department about sharing information with R&D cannot regulate the newness of the product program,0,9,2481,(x1: 490.71 y1: 210.37) (x2: 340.17 y2: 278.00),"As Table 3 shows, R&D power had a significant, linear, positive effect on product program newness (γ11= .265; p < .05).","As Table 3 shows, R&D power had a significant, linear, positive effect on product program newness (gamma_11 = .265; p < .05).",0,8,0,(x1: 62.36 y1: 334.88) (x2: 81.97 y2: 365.21),(γ11= .265; p < .05).,gamma_11 = .265; p < .05,8,98,(x1: 243.85 y1: 347.35) (x2: 81.97 y2: 365.21),Ruth Maria Stock,rsh@stock-homburg.de,1,kxq1x

Online reputation, however, is not directly connected to a person, but only to the virtual identity of that person. Users can therefore shed a negative reputation by creating a new account. We study the effects of such identity changes on the efficiency of reputation systems. We compare two markets in which we exogenously vary whether sellers can erase their rating profile and start over as new sellers. Buyer trust and seller trustworthiness decrease significantly when sellers can erase their ratings. With identity changes, trust is particularly low towards new sellers since buyers cannot discriminate between truly new sellers and opportunistic sellers who changed their identity. Nevertheless, we observe positive returns on buyer investment under the reputation system with identity changes, and our evidence suggests that trustworthiness is higher than in the complete absence of a reputation system.","[Wibral, Matthias] Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Wibral, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",wibral@uni-bonn.de,"German Research Foundation [KR 2077/2-1, SFB/TR 15]",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,2015,18,3,10.1007/s10683-014-9410-3,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000359396900005,408-431,Wibral,Matthias,15-Sep,Wibral_ExpEco_2015_o86ny.pdf,Buyer trust | decrease significantly when sellers can erase their ratings.,Buyer trust | decrease significantly when sellers can erase their ratings.,0,1 | 1,776 | 815,(x1: 233.63 y1: 328.86) (x2: 279.60 y2: 333.53) | (x1: 51.02 y1: 340.82) (x2: 291.49 y2: 345.49),Trust in the change treatment will be lower than in the no-change treatment (only) because new sellers will receive lower investments.,Trust in the change treatment will be lower than in the no-change treatment (only) because new sellers will receive lower investments.,0,8,287,(x1: 356.31 y1: 96.93) (x2: 228.81 y2: 125.52),"Buyers trust more when sellers cannot change their identity.

In this experiment clients are faced with a variant of a multi-armed bandit problem with a random end-time. On the known arm (the ""task screen""), clients can earn a certain payment per completion of a decoding task. However, clients may also opt for the unknown arm where they earn an uncertain amount if they end the experiment on this ""expert screen"". The amount is uncertain to the clients because the value is being communicated through an ""expert"" with conflicted incentives. A control session provides for direct transmission of the value to the clients. Our results show that ambiguity aversion is alive-and-well in this environment.

In this paper, we examine how relatively mild temporal variations in cognition affect reasoning in the Beauty Contest. The source of temporal cognition variation that we explore is the time-of-day that decisions are made. Our first result is that circadian mismatched subjects (i.e., those making decisions at off-peak time of day) display lower levels of strategic reasoning in the p < 1 Beauty Contest but not in the p > 1 game. This suggests that a cognitively more challenging environment is required for circadian mismatch to harm strategic reasoning. A second result is that choice adaptation or mimicry (i.e., a more automatic type of responding than what is typically considered to be ""learning"") during repeated play is not significantly affected by circadian mismatch. This is consistent with the hypothesis that automatic thought is more resilient to cognitive resource depletion than controlled-thought decision making.","[Dickinson, David L.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [McElroy, Todd] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Dickinson, DL (reprint author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dickinsondl@appstate.edu,,SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,2012,15,3,10.1007/s10683-011-9307-3,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000306790700004,444-459,Dickinson,David L.,12-Sep,Dickinson_ExpEco_2012_jmdrp.pdf,"circadian mismatched subjects (i.e., those making decisions at off-peak time of day) display lower levels of strategic reasoning in the p < 1 Beauty Contest","circadian mismatched subjects (i.e., those making decisions at off-peak time of day) display lower levels of strategic reasoning in the p < 1 Beauty Contest",0,1,602,(x1: 69.69 y1: 300.11) (x2: 357.63 y2: 317.62),First-round guesses—when the task or parameterization is novel—will be farther from the equilibrium for circadian mismatched subjects.,First-round guesses—when the task or parameterization is novel—will be farther from the equilibrium for circadian mismatched subjects.,0,6,2964,(x1: 110.76 y1: 527.72) (x2: 316.50 y2: 545.30),"Circadian mismatch is estimated to be statistically significant in two of the three models, and in the predicted direction—mismatch harms behavioral outcomes.

Based on conservation of resources theory and the concept of loss spirals, we hypothesized that when an employee's work interferes with family demands, the resulting work-to-family conflict spills over to the work domain via employee emotional exhaustion. We further argued that the behavioral manifestation of employee emotional exhaustion in the workplace is low employee engagement, as assessed by the supervisor. Drawing on signaling theory, we proposed that supervisor assessments of employee engagement are related to promotability, performance ratings, and salary. Work scheduling autonomy, as a boundary condition, is examined as a resource that attenuates these relationships. Data collected from 192 employee-supervisor dyads of a Fortune 1000 company, as well as performance ratings and salary obtained from company records 9months later, indicated support for our conceptual model.

Professionally diverse healthcare teams are increasingly used to develop innovative clinical approaches and solve complex healthcare problems; however, there is evidence that collaboration across professional boundaries creates conflict and is frequently unsuccessful. Healthcare organizations consequently face a dilemma. If they embrace professional diversity in teams, they risk interprofessional hostility, but if they choose homogeneous teams, they diminish their teams' capacity to innovate. We respond to this quandary by utilizing social identity theory to better understand the mechanisms through which professional diversity can enhance team innovation. In particular, we argue that professional identity salience operates as a mediator capable of explaining both positive and negative outcomes of professional diversity, contingent on the moderating effect of openmindedness norms. Analysis of survey data from 70 healthcare teams supports our model and indicates that professional salience can both enhance and undermine team innovation, depending on the extent of team openmindedness.

Specifically, given the increasing number of collaborations in academia and the crucial role networks play in knowledge creation, we investigate the extent to which building social capital within the academic community represents a valuable resource for a scientist's knowledge-creation process. We measure the social capital in terms of structural position within the academic collaborative network. Furthermore, we analyse the extent to which an academic scientist's research specialization and ties that cross-community boundaries act as moderators of the aforementioned relationship. Empirical results derived from an analysis of an Italian academic community from 2001 to 2008 suggest academic scientists that build social capital by occupying central positions in the community outperform their more isolated colleagues. However, scientific productivity declines beyond a certain threshold value of centrality, hence revealing the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship. This relationship is negatively moderated by the extent to which an academic focuses research activities in few scientific knowledge domains, whereas it is positively moderated by the number of cross-community ties established.

Consequently, this paper develops and investigates a novel construct, knowledge hiding. We establish that knowledge hiding exists, we distinguish knowledge hiding from related concepts (knowledge hoarding and knowledge sharing), and we develop a multidimensional measure of this construct. We also identify several predictors of knowledge hiding in organizations. The results of three studies, using different methods, suggest that knowledge hiding is comprised of three related factors: evasive hiding, rationalized hiding, and playing dumb. Each of these hiding behaviors is predicted by distrust, yet each also has a different set of interpersonal and organizational predictors.

This study examined the effect of landmarks' use and the effect of landmarks' frames of reference in route instructions on navigation efficiency during map navigation tasks and satisfaction. Twenty-seven participants performed map navigation tasks using a simulated speech navigation system in three experimental conditions: instructions containing no landmarks, instructions containing landmarks located without reference to either the traveler's body or the surrounding environment, and instructions containing landmarks located with respect to the traveler's body. Navigation performances on maps were higher and landmarks enable participants to make fewer directional errors and find their routes more efficiently. Satisfaction levels and navigation performances were lower when instructions did not contain any landmarks.

When performance was incentivized with monetary rewards, participants reported being more desirous of money (Study 1), put in more effort to earn additional money in an ensuing task (Study 2), and were less willing to donate money to charity (Study 4).

In the current research, we explore the possibility that having high self-control also may have some interpersonal costs, leading individuals to become burdened by others' reliance. In Studies 1 and 2, we examined the effects of actors' self-control on observers' performance expectations and found that observers had higher performance expectations for actors with high (vs. low) self-control. In Study 3, we tested the effect of actors' self-control on work assigned to actors and found that observers assigned greater workloads to actors with high (vs. low) self-control. In Study 4, we examined how actors and observers differed in their assessments of the effort expended by high and low self-control actors and found that observers (but not actors) reported that high self-control actors expended less effort than low self-control actors. Finally, we found that people high (vs. low) in self-control reported greater burden from the reliance of coworkers (Study 5) and romantic partners (Study 6), and this tendency led them to feel less satisfied with their relationships (Study 6). Together, results from these studies provide novel evidence that individuals' self-control affects others' attitudes and behaviors toward them, and suggest that these interpersonal dynamics can have negative consequences for high self-control individuals.","[Koval, Christy Zhou; Fitzsimons, Grainne M.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Vandellen, Michelle R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ranby, Krista W.] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80204 USA","Fitzsimons, GM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",grainne.fitzsimons@duke.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2015,108,5,10.1037/pspi0000015,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000353578700006,750-766,Koval,Christy Zhou,15-May,Koval_JournPerSocPsy_2015_q092m.pdf,"In Study 3, we tested the effect of actors’ self-control on work assigned to actors and found that observers assigned greater workloads to actors with high (vs. low) self-control.","In Study 3, we tested the effect of actors’ self-control on work assigned to actors and found that observers assigned greater workloads to actors with high (vs. low) self-control.",0,1,824,(x1: 320.24 y1: 264.54) (x2: 221.23 y2: 289.00),"We predicted that participants would assign a greater workload—more essays—to the high self-control student, compared to both students who exhibited lower levels of self- control","We predicted that participants would assign a greater workload—more essays—to the high self-control student, compared to both students who exhibited lower levels of self- control",0,7,550,(x1: 121.57 y1: 176.98) (x2: 73.50 y2: 215.00),"Tests of means revealed that participants assigned greater number of essays to the target who exhibited high self-control (M  2.86, SD  0.67) than | the low self-control target, (M 2.16, SD  0.63), t(124)  6.82, p  .001","Tests of means revealed that participants assigned greater number of essays to the target who exhibited high self-control (M = 2.86, SD = 0.67) than...the low self-control target, (M = 2.16, SD = 0.63), t(124) = 6.82, p < .001...",0,8 | 8,1255 | 1480,(x1: 182.23 y1: 297.98) (x2: 272.10 y2: 325.00) | (x1: 104.55 y1: 341.98) (x2: 139.20 y2: 358.00),"t(124)  6.82, p  .001","t(124) = 6.82, p < .001",8,1529,(x1: 48.00 y1: 353.05) (x2: 139.20 y2: 358.00),Grainne M.

Why would anyone favor a position of apparent disadvantage? In 5 studies, we found that the broad construct of status striving can be broken up into two conceptions: one based on rank, the other on respect. While individuals might universally desire high levels of respect, we find that they vary widely in the extent to which they strive for high-status rank, with many individuals opting for middle- or low-status rank. The status rank that individuals preferred depended on their self-perceived value to the group: when they believed they provided less value, they preferred lower status rank. Mediation and moderation analyses suggest that beliefs about others' expectations were the primary driver of these effects. Individuals who believed they provided little value to their group inferred that others expected them to occupy a lower status position. Individuals in turn conformed to these perceived expectations, accepting lower status rank in such settings.","[Anderson, Cameron; Willer, Robb; Brown, Courtney E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Anderson, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 545 Student Serv Bldg 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",anderson@haas.berkeley.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,2012,102,5,10.1037/a0027409,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,WOS:000303221400012,1077-1088,Anderson,Cameron,12-May,Anderson_JournPerSocPsy_2012_qd5p2.pdf,"when they believed they provided less value, they preferred lower status rank","when they believed they provided less value, they preferred lower status rank",0,1,824,(x1: 197.69 y1: 228.54) (x2: 463.00 y2: 233.00),"Individuals who believe they possess high levels of the skills and abilities that contribute to the group’s success will pursue higher status rank, whereas those who believe they lack such skills and are incapable of making important contributions will opt for lower status rank.","Individuals who believe they possess high levels of the skills and abilities that contribute to the group’s success will pursue higher status rank, whereas those who believe they lack such skills and are incapable of making important contributions will opt for lower status rank.",0,2,2390,(x1: 48.00 y1: 517.98) (x2: 89.74 y2: 566.99),"Consistent with our hypotheses, participants in the high relative ability condition preferred a higher status rank (M  .18, SD  .86) than those in the low relative ability condition (M   .19, SD  .76), t(102)  2.29, p  .024","Consistent with our hypotheses, participants in the high relative ability condition preferred a higher status rank (M = .18, SD = .86) than those in the low relative ability condition (M = -.19, SD = .76), t(102) = 2.29, p = .024.",0,6,1756,(x1: 57.00 y1: 437.97) (x2: 180.09 y2: 475.99),"t(102)  2.29, p  .024","t(102) = 2.29, p = .024",6,1958,(x1: 91.19 y1: 471.05) (x2: 180.09 y2: 475.99),Cameron Anderson,anderson@haas.berkely.edu,1,kx736

Drawing from social identity theory and the brand loyalty literature, the authors propose a conceptual framework to examine these issues in a specific market disruption, namely, the introduction of a radically new brand. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers' identification with and perceived value of the incumbent relative to the new brand on switching behavior. The authors divert from the conventional economic perspective of treating brand switching as functional utility maximization to propose that brand switching can also result from customers' social mobility between brand identities. The results from longitudinal data of 679 customers during the launch of the iPhone in Spain show that both relative customer brand identification and relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. Relative customer brand identification with the incumbent apparently exerts a stronger longitudinal restraint on switching behavior than relative perceived value of the incumbent. The study has important strategic implications for devising customer relationship strategies and brand investment.","[Lam, Son K.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ahearne, Michael] Univ Houston, Sales Excellence Inst, Coll Business, Houston, TX 77004 USA; Univ Houston, Coll Business, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Schillewaert, Niels] Vlerick Leuven Gent Management Sch, Louvain, Belgium","Lam, SK (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",sonlam@terry.uga.edu; mahearne@uh.edu; yehu@uh.edu; Niels.Schillewaert@insites.eu,,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA",0022-2429,1547-7185,2010,74,6,10.1509/jmkg.74.6.128,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000283027200008,128-146,Lam,Son K.,10-Nov,Lam_JournMarket_2010_o58bg.pdf,relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior,relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior,0,1,1243,(x1: 133.85 y1: 258.27) (x2: 436.42 y2: 264.05),"H1: At the time of the new brand’s introduction, the greater the relative perceived value of the incumbent brand, the lower is the probability that a customer will switch to the new brand","H1: At the time of the new brand’s introduction, the greater the relative perceived value of the incumbent brand, the lower is the probability that a customer will switch to the new brand",0,8,973,(x1: 69.00 y1: 241.83) (x2: 121.48 y2: 277.56),"relative perceived value (β = –.72, p < .01) | greatly reduced the switching probability","...relative perceived value (Beta = -.72, p < .01)...greatly reduced the switching probability.",0,13 | 13,886 | 968,(x1: 199.05 y1: 578.03) (x2: 135.45 y2: 595.13) | (x1: 54.00 y1: 601.07) (x2: 221.40 y2: 606.65),"β = –.72, p < .01)","Beta = -.72, p < .01",13,912,(x1: 57.33 y1: 588.61) (x2: 135.45 y2: 595.13),Son K.

Paradoxically, disgust may be reduced by frequent exposure to disgust-inducing cues - cues most likely to occur in disease-rich environments. In this study, we examined whether more frequent or recent illness might act to reverse this process. To test this, we surveyed 616 adults, obtaining illness frequency and recency data, disgust and contamination sensitivity, and a variety of control measures. Heightened contamination sensitivity was associated with more frequent infectious illness, but not with recency of infection. We also found that participants who had heightened contamination sensitivity and who were also more disgust sensitive had significantly fewer recent infections. These findings suggest that frequent illness may up-regulate contamination sensitivity potentially counteracting the effects of exposure on disgust. More importantly, these data provide the first direct evidence of a protective effect of contamination and disgust, against infectious disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

These effects were specific to inspiration (instead of adjacent affective experiences) and a belief in God (instead of other empirically unverifiable claims). Being inspired by someone or something (but not inspired to do something) offers a spiritually transcendent experience that elevates belief in God, in part because it makes people feel connected to something beyond themselves.","[Critcher, Clayton R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 545 Student Serv Bldg 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Chan Jean] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Daejeon, South Korea","Critcher, CR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 545 Student Serv Bldg 1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ClaytonCritcher@haas.berkeley.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,2018,29,5,10.1177/0956797617743017,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,WOS:000432115000005,723-737,Critcher,Clayton R.,18-May,Critcher_PsychologSci_2018_j1gn7.pdf,Participants who dispositionally experience more inspiration | showed stronger belief in God,Participants who dispositionally experience more inspiration | showed stronger belief in God,0,1 | 1,3452 | 3642,(x1: 85.32 y1: 297.65) (x2: 350.12 y2: 303.15) | (x1: 416.63 y1: 309.65) (x2: 552.35 y2: 315.15),"we tested whether people who disposition- ally feel more inspiration (but not necessarily chills, another intense emotionally laden experience) are also more confident in God’s existence.","we tested whether people who disposition- ally feel more inspiration (but not necessarily chills, another intense emotionally laden experience) are also more confident in God’s existence.",0,2,3148,(x1: 364.80 y1: 190.52) (x2: 462.98 y2: 232.02),"First, and as predicted, the more participants reported feeling inspired in their day-to-day lives, the more strongly they believed in God, r(344) = .22, p < .001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.11, .31]","First, and as predicted, the more participants reported feeling inspired in their day-to-day lives, the more strongly they believed in God, r(344) = .22, p < .001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.11, .31].",0,3,2912,(x1: 310.50 y1: 322.52) (x2: 491.81 y2: 364.02),"r(344) = .22, p < .001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.11, .31","r(344) = .22, p < .001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.11, .31]",3,3052,(x1: 453.94 y1: 346.48) (x2: 489.19 y2: 364.02),Clayton R.

In this sequence of relationships, a commonly overlooked factor by marketers is the volatility of customers' cash flows. This study links different recurring customer behaviors to the future level and volatility of a customer's cash flows. Empirical analyses of the large customer database of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash flow volatility and $39.42 million increase in the future cash flow level of the firm. Furthermore, firm-initiated marketing is 1.9-3.2 times more effective at managing the future cash flow level and volatility when it is selectively targeted to customers with certain characteristics. Overall, the study enables marketers to manage different customer behaviors that influence customers' future cash flow level and volatility and ultimately quantify the impact of these behaviors on the shareholder value of the firm.","[Shah, Denish; Kumar, V.; Kim, Kihyun Hannah; Choi, Jeewon Brianna] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore","Kumar, V (reprint author), Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",shah@gsu.edu; vk@gsu.edu; kh.kim@business.rutgers.edu; jchoi43@gsu.edu,,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,2017,54,1,10.1509/jmr.15.0158,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000395374700003,27-43,Shah,Denish,17-Feb,Shah_JournMarketRes_2017_jrx9l.pdf,"Empirical analyses of the large customer database of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash ﬂow volatility and $39.42 million increase in the future cash ﬂow level of the

Prior research on the attraction effect has demonstrated how the introduction of an option into a choice set increases the share of one of the original options. The authors examine the related but previously unaddressed issue of whether the unexpected exit of an option from a choice set returns the choice shares of the original options to the status quo. In a series of experiments, they observe that when an option turns out to be unselectable following a choice problem in which it was selectable, the choice shares of the remaining options are predictably different from those of a choice problem in which the option was unselectable from the start. They also observe that this attraction effect due to the disappearance of a decoy is likely a consequence of changes in the importance of decision criteria.

We investigated the question by testing reasoning about third party ownership conflicts in various groups of three- and five-year-old children (N = 176), growing up in seven highly contrasted social, economic, and cultural circumstances (urban rich, poor, very poor, rural poor, and traditional) spanning three continents. Each child was presented with a series of scripts involving two identical dolls fighting over an object of possession. The child had to decide who of the two dolls should own the object. Each script enacted various potential reasons for attributing ownership: creation, familiarity, first contact, equity, plus a control/neutral condition with no suggested reasons. Results show that across cultures, children are significantly more consistent and decisive in attributing ownership when one of the protagonists created the object. Development between three and five years is more or less pronounced depending on culture. The propensity to split the object in equal halves whenever possible was generally higher at certain locations (i.e., China) and quasi-inexistent in others (i.e., Vanuatu and street children of Recife). Overall, creation reasons appear to be more primordial and stable across cultures than familiarity, relative wealth or first contact.

Three hundred eighty-two participants took part in one of the 17 speed-dating sessions. After each speed-dating interaction, participants indicated how interesting they found the respective person as a long-term and short-term partner. Using social relations analyses, we computed perceiver effects (being more or less choosy) and target effects (being rated as more or less interesting) of long-term and short-term partner ratings. Self-enhancement was operationalized as the discrepancy between self-rated attractiveness and four components of actual attractiveness (observer-rated facial and vocal attractiveness, height and body mass index). Results indicated that self-enhancers were less choosy with respect to their interest for short-term partners, which was especially true for men, but more choosy with respect to long-term partners. With regard to popularity as a mate, potential partners indicated that they found self-enhancers more interesting as short-term partners but not as long-term partners.

However in considering this specific context, the authors highlight how, where and why such a normative approach to employee factors may be limited and thus, proposes through a framework which brings together big data principles, implementation approaches and management commitment requirements can be applied and harnessed more effectively in order to assess employee attitudes and behaviors as part of wider HR predictive analytics (HRPA) approaches.

In Stage 1, product attributes are identified based on interviews with consumers. In Stage 2, a survey is conducted with a different set of consumers in order to classify the product attributes into primary, secondary or tertiary attributes and to test the hypotheses. The results reveal that primary, secondary and tertiary attributes have a reverse hierarchical influence on actualized innovativeness. That is, tertiary attributes influence the actualized innovativeness most, followed by secondary, and then by primary attributes. However, only primary attributes positively moderate the relationship between inherent and actualized innovativeness. These results can help marketing researchers and practitioners understand the influence of product attributes on behavioral aspects of consumer innovativeness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Given the increasing number of school-aged children with incarcerated parents, this study explores the ways paternal incarceration is associated with mothers' and fathers' reports of home-and school-based involvement in schooling. Using Fragile Families Study data, we find that a father's incarceration inhibits his school-and home-based involvement in schooling, but associations for maternal involvement are weaker. Results are robust to alternative specifications of incarceration that address concerns about selection and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings also hold across levels of father-child contact. We also conducted a test of the system avoidance mechanism and results suggest it partially explains reductions in school involvement for fathers following incarceration. Given the reoccurring interest in the interconnection between families and schools and how this translates into success, this study suggests that paternal incarceration is associated with lower parental involvement in schooling and highlights the role of system avoidance in this association. Attachment to social institutions like schools is quite consequential, and this work highlights another way mass incarceration influences social life in the United States.","[Haskinsa, Anna R.] Cornell Univ, Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Haskinsa, Anna R.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Prison Educ Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Haskinsa, Anna R.] Cornell Univ, Ctr Study Inequal, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Haskinsa, Anna R.] Cornell Univ, Ctr Study Inequal, Cornell Populat Ctr, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Jacobsen, Wade C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Criminol & Criminal Justice, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Haskinsa, AR (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, 354 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",arh96@cornell.edu,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01HD36916, R01HD39135, R01HD40421]",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2017,82,4,10.1177/0003122417709294,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000406179200001,657-684,Haskinsa,Anna R.,17-Aug,Haskins_AmSocioRev_2017_60977.pdf,"Using Fragile Families Study data, we find that a father’s incarceration inhibits his school- | based involvement in schooling","Using Fragile Families Study data, we find that a father’s incarceration inhibits his school- | based involvement in schooling",0,1 | 1,1669 | 1772,(x1: 191.70 y1: 317.71) (x2: 187.24 y2: 334.02) | (x1: 233.25 y1: 328.71) (x2: 364.02 y2: 334.02),"Paternal incarceration, whether past or recent, thus has the potential to hinder | school-based parental involvement in schooling","Paternal incarceration, whether past or recent, thus has the potential to hinder | school-based parental involvement in schooling",0,5 | 5,2573 | 2664,(x1: 264.00 y1: 176.40) (x2: 406.13 y2: 193.94) | (x1: 273.20 y1: 200.40) (x2: 290.49 y2: 217.94),"Table 2 presents bivariate and multivariable regres- sion results for the full analytic sample | After adding controls, the association between whether the father was ever incarcer- ated and his involvement in school-based activities continues to be strong, negative, and statistically significant (β = –.323), | suggesting a 28 percent reduction [(e–.323) − 1 100] in the odds of involvement.","...Table 2 presents bivariate and multivariable regression results for the full analytic sample...After adding controls, the association between whether the father was ever incarcerated and his involvement in school-based activities continues to be strong, negative, and statistically significant (beta = –.323), suggesting a 28 percent reduction [(e–.323) − 1 100] in the odds of involvement.

These models have done much to advance our understanding of behavior, but they focus on generic processes rather than specific cultural content. As useful as this has been, it tells us little about which forms of culture matter for action. Drawing on a cross-disciplinary set of theory and evidence, I argue that values are tied to many forms of behavior, across both contexts and cultures, and they operate in ways consistent with dual-process models. I illustrate the plausibility of these claims using data from the second wave of the European Social Survey, as well as real-time decision data from a large, online survey. I show that values predict self-reported behaviors in a variety of substantive domains and across 25 nations, and they operate using automatic cognitive processes. These findings suggest that values merit renewed theoretical and empirical attention.","Univ Toronto, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Miles, A (reprint author), Univ Toronto, William G Davis Bldg,Room DV 3217, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",andrew.miles@utoronto.ca,John Templeton Foundation [21869]; Brigham Young University's College of Religious Education,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2015,80,4,10.1177/0003122415591800,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000358879100001,680-704,Miles,Andrew,15-Aug,Miles_AmSocioRev_2015_3xrnm.pdf,I show that values predict self-reported behaviors in a variety of substantive domains,I show that values predict self-reported behaviors in a variety of substantive domains,0,1,2657,(x1: 83.30 y1: 332.70) (x2: 434.49 y2: 338.01),Results are consistent with the claim that val- ues are causally linked to behavior,Results are consistent with the claim that val- ues are causally linked to behavior,0,19,133,(x1: 51.49 y1: 370.97) (x2: 195.72 y2: 388.51),Model 1 of Table 2 displays results for unweighted (A) | regressions that pool self-transcendence effects across the low and high cognitive load conditions. | self-transcendence predicts higher log odds of giving five tickets (versus fewer than five).,"Model 1 of Table 2 displays results for unweighted (A)...regressions that pool self-transcendence effects across the low and high cognitive load conditions....self-transcendence predicts higher log odds of giving five tickets (versus fewer than five).

Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents' sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation.","[Gerhards, Juergen; Hans, Silke] Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany","Gerhards, J (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany.",,,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0002-9602,1537-5390,2009,114,4,10.1086/595944,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000264559600005,1102-1128,Gerhards,Juergen,9-Jan,Gerhards_AmJournSocio_2009_5xb7l.pdf,"Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: | the parents’ sociostructural integration in terms of | citizenship","Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: | the parents’ sociostructural integration in terms of | citizenship",0,1 | 1 | 1,617 | 892 | 959,(x1: 333.70 y1: 328.39) (x2: 361.73 y2: 365.27) | (x1: 407.90 y1: 370.23) (x2: 341.53 y2: 386.19) | (x1: 412.85 y1: 380.69) (x2: 458.19 y2: 386.19),We will test the hypothesis that the acquisition of German citizenship has a positive effect on acculturation insofar as the choice of first names is concerned.,We will test the hypothesis that the acquisition of German citizenship has a positive effect on acculturation insofar as the choice of first names is concerned.,0,11,350,(x1: 237.39 y1: 197.48) (x2: 297.39 y2: 226.89),Table 9 shows five regression models. | The fifth and final model controls for the inﬂuence of citizenship.

Although female leaders were rated as more effective than male leaders overall, a fine-grained analysis of leader-subordinate dyads revealed that the male leaders benefited more than the female leaders from the use of transformational leadership in the leader behavior-leader effectiveness relationship. Implications and future research directions are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we examined one pathway through which this link occurs. Specifically, we sought to determine whether the relation between positive family functioning and transformational leadership was mediated through adolescent self-concept. Repeated measures from participants, ages 12 through 29 years (N = 106), in the Fullerton Longitudinal Study were analyzed using multilevel structural equation models (MSEM). The results indicated a significant relation between family functioning and transformational leadership mediated by self-concept, controlling for socioeconomic status. When parents provided a stimulating and supportive environment, adolescents reported a more positive general self-concept, which subsequently related to transformational leadership qualities in adulthood.

There is, for example, considerably less world trade than predicted by Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) models. Trade among rich countries is higher and trade between rich and poor countries lower than suggested by HOV and other supply-driven theories, and trade-to-GDP ratios are higher in rich countries. Our approach focuses on the relationship between characteristics of goods and services in production and characteristics of preferences. In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good's skilled-labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences. Exploring the implications of this correlation for empirical trade puzzles, we find that it can reduce HOV's overprediction of the variance of the net factor content of trade relative to that in the data by about 60%. Since rich countries are relatively skilled-labor abundant, they are relatively specialized in consuming the same goods and services that they are specialized in producing, and so trade more with one another than with poor countries. We also find a positive sector-level correlation between income elasticity and a sector's tradability, which helps explain the higher trade-to-GDP ratios in high-income relative to low-income countries.","[Caron, Justin] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Caron, J (reprint author), MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,2014,129,3,10.1093/qje/qju010,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000342236000010,1501-1552,Caron,Justin,14-Aug,Caron_QuartJournEco_2014_mp407.pdf,"In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good’s skilled- labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences","In particular, we find a strong and significant positive correlation of more than 45% between a good’s skilled- labor intensity and its income elasticity, even when accounting for trade costs and cross-country price differences",0,1,714,(x1: 256.59 y1: 228.54) (x2: 211.81 y2: 262.60),"Here we find a strong, positive correlation (higher than 45%) between a good’s income elasticity of demand and its skilled-labor intensity in production.

There are three main results. First, the status quo system was largely corrupted, with auditors systematically reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although true emissions were typically higher. Second, the treatment caused auditors to report more truthfully and very significantly lowered the fraction of plants that were falsely reported as compliant with pollution standards. Third, treatment plants, in turn, reduced their pollution emissions.

Consistent with the latter approach, I find that internally divided movements receive concessions at a much higher rate than unitary ones and that the more divided the movement is the more likely it is to receive concessions. Yet, concessions to unitary movements appear to work better to settle these disputes.

We provide direct tests of both models of attitude formation using an original survey experiment embedded in a nationwide U.S. survey. The labor market competition model predicts that natives will be most opposed to immigrants who have skill levels similar to their own. We find instead that both low-skilled and highly skilled natives strongly prefer highly skilled immigrants over low-skilled immigrants, and this preference is not decreasing in natives' skill levels. The fiscal burden model anticipates that rich natives oppose low-skilled immigration more than poor natives, and that this gap is larger in states with greater fiscal exposure (in terms of immigrant access to public services). We find instead that rich and poor natives are equally opposed to low-skilled immigration in general. In states with high fiscal exposure, poor (rich) natives are more (less) opposed to low-skilled immigration than they are elsewhere. This indicates that concerns among poor natives about constraints on welfare benefits as a result of immigration are more relevant than concerns among the rich about increased taxes. Overall the results suggest that economic self-interest, at least as currently theorized, does not explain voter attitudes toward immigration. The results are consistent with alternative arguments emphasizing noneconomic concerns associated with ethnocentrism or sociotropic considerations about how the local economy as a whole may be affected by immigration.","[Hainmueller, Jens] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hiscox, Michael J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Hainmueller, J (reprint author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jhainm@mit.edu; hiscox@fas.harvard.edu,,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,2010,104,1,10.1017/s0003055409990372,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000276532500004,61-84,Hainmueller,Jens,10-Feb,HAINMUELLER_AmPoliSciRev_2010_p96vn.pdf,"In states with high fiscal exposure, poor (rich) natives are more (less) opposed to low-skilled immigration than they are elsewhere.","In states with high fiscal exposure, poor (rich) natives are more (less) opposed to low-skilled immigration than they are elsewhere.",0,1,1316,(x1: 500.65 y1: 232.52) (x2: 175.69 y2: 260.17),"rich natives prefer highly skilled over low-skilled immigrants less than poor natives, and the difference should be larger in states with high fis- cal exposure to immigrants than in states with low ex- posure.","rich natives prefer highly skilled over low-skilled immigrants less than poor natives, and the difference should be larger in states with high fis- cal exposure to immigrants than in states with low ex- posure.",0,16,2802,(x1: 149.98 y1: 646.77) (x2: 90.61 y2: 696.45),The upper panel in Table 2 presents the estimation results. | In columns | 3 we restrict the estimation to the subsamples of states that are characterized by a high level of fis- cal immigrant exposure according to | FISCAL EXPOSURE | II | For FISCAL EXPOSURE II the negative interaction term is also highly statistically significant | This indicates that in high–fiscal exposure states the pre- mium attached to highly skilled immigration relative to low-skilled immigration is decreasing in respondents’ income level,"The upper panel in Table 2 presents the estimation results...In columns...3 we restrict the estimation to the subsamples of states that are characterized by a high level of fiscal immigrant exposure according to...FISCAL EXPOSURE...II...For FISCAL EXPOSURE II the negative interaction term is also highly statistically significant...This indicates that in high–fiscal exposure states the premium attached to highly skilled immigration relative to low-skilled immigration is decreasing in respondents’ income level...[Table 2, Level of Fiscal Exposure, High, Measure of Fiscal Exposure, II, Dependent Variable Model No., 3, HSKFRAME.INCOME, order probit coefficient = -0.20, standard error = 0.10]",1,16 | 17 | 17 | 17 | 17 | 17 | 17,3765 | 416 | 433 | 590 | 612 | 721 | 905,(x1: 310.21 y1: 713.25) (x2: 340.39 y2: 730.06) | (x1: 235.49 y1: 120.97) (x2: 282.88 y2: 126.82) | (x1: 78.21 y1: 131.93) (x2: 205.91 y2: 159.70) | (x1: 49.76 y1: 164.81) (x2: 147.75 y2: 170.66) | (x1: 174.84 y1: 164.81) (x2: 182.59 y2: 170.66) | (x1: 158.50 y1: 186.72) (x2: 93.49 y2: 214.49) | (x1: 264.46 y1: 219.60) (x2: 105.30 y2: 269.28),Level of Fiscal Exposure | High | Measure of Fiscal Exposure | II | Dependent Variable Model No. | 3 | HSKFRAME·INCOME | −0.20 | (0.10) | Order probit coefficients shown with standard errors in parentheses,"Table 2, Level of Fiscal Exposure, High, Measure of Fiscal Exposure, II, Dependent Variable Model No., 3, HSKFRAME.INCOME, order probit coefficient = -0.20, standard error = 0.10",16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16,190,(x1: 74.85 y1: 106.85) (x2: 172.04 y2: 112.03) | (x1: 291.80 y1: 106.85) (x2: 310.24 y2: 112.03) | (x1: 74.85 y1: 123.78) (x2: 185.99 y2: 128.96) | (x1: 322.18 y1: 123.78) (x2: 327.16 y2: 128.96) | (x1: 74.85 y1: 150.69) (x2: 196.43 y2: 155.87) | (x1: 322.20 y1: 150.69) (x2: 327.19 y2: 155.87) | (x1: 74.85 y1: 181.97) (x2: 163.04 y2: 187.15) | (x1: 308.97 y1: 179.31) (x2: 333.39 y2: 187.15) | (x1: 312.97 y1: 191.93) (x2: 336.37 y2: 197.11) | (x1: 74.85 y1: 428.57) (x2: 313.99 y2: 433.18),Jens Hainmueller,jhainm@mit.edu,1,g18lj

Drawing on theories of prosocial motivation and action identification, we propose that family motivation increases job performance by enhancing energy and reducing stress, and it is especially important when intrinsic motivation is lacking. Survey and diary data collected across multiple time points in a Mexican maquiladora generally support our model. Specifically, we find that family motivation enhances job performance when intrinsic motivation is low-in part by providing energy, but not by reducing stress. We conclude that supporting a family provides a powerful source of motivation that can boost performance in the workplace, offering meaningful implications for research on motivation and the dynamics of work and family engagement.","[Menges, Jochen I.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Leadership & Human Resource Management, Vallendar, Germany; [Tussing, Danielle V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wihler, Andreas] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Grant, Adam M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Management & Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Menges, JI (reprint author), WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Leadership & Human Resource Management, Vallendar, Germany.",jochen.menges@whu.edu; dvtuss@wharton.upenn.edu; wihler@uni-bonn.de; grantad@wharton.upenn.edu,,ACAD MANAGEMENT,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",0001-4273,1948-0989,2017,60,2,10.5465/amj.2014.0898,Business; Management,Business & Economics,WOS:000399544800012,695-719,Menges,Jochen I.,Apr 1 2017,Menges_AcaManageJourn_2017_74pxy.pdf,we find that family motivation enhances job performance when intrinsic moti- vation is low,we find that family motivation enhances job performance when intrinsic moti- vation is low,0,1,925,(x1: 143.66 y1: 360.29) (x2: 170.03 y2: 376.61),"Hypothesis 2.

In the data, when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens and the spread on short-term bonds rises more than the spread on long-term bonds. We build a dynamic model of international borrowing with endogenous default and multiple debt maturities. Long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in spreads, whereas short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay. The trade-off between these hedging and incentive benefits is quantitatively important for understanding the maturity structure in emerging markets.","[Arellano, Cristina] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Arellano, Cristina] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramanarayanan, Ananth] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada","Arellano, C (reprint author), Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.",,,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,2012,120,2,10.1086/666589,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000305085900001,187-232,Arellano,Cristina,12-Apr,Arellano_JournPoliEco_2012_3bpyv.pdf,"when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens","when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens",0,1,501,(x1: 123.54 y1: 312.96) (x2: 338.99 y2: 318.24),"we conclude | that in times of high spreads, the maturity of debt shortens","we conclude | that in times of high spreads, the maturity of debt shortens",0,2 | 3,2780 | 40,(x1: 322.73 y1: 518.60) (x2: 376.58 y2: 524.47) | (x1: 65.75 y1: 64.31) (x2: 330.46 y2: 70.18),Column 1 reports the effect of the 1-year spread on the duration of new issuances.

Previous findings have been mixed regarding the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and child cognitive development. The objective of this study was to systematically review relevant literature and to perform a meta-analysis. Method. Three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO) were searched. Initial screening was conducted independently by two reviewers. Studies selected for detailed review were read in full and included based on a set of criteria. Data from selected studies were abstracted onto a standardized form. Meta-analysis using the inverse variance approach and random-effects models was conducted. Results. The univariate analysis of 14 studies revealed that maternal depressive symptoms are related to lower cognitive scores among children aged456 months (Cohen's d =-0.25, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.12). The synthesis of studies controlling for confounding variables showed that the mean cognitive score for children 6-8 weeks post-partum whose mothers had high depressive symptoms during the first few weeks postpartum was approximately 4.2 units lower on the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID) compared with children with non-symptomatic mothers ((B) over cap=-4.17, 95% CI -8.01 to -0.32). Conclusions. The results indicated that maternal depressive symptoms are related to lower cognitive scores in early infancy, after adjusting for confounding factors. An integrated approach for supporting child cognitive development may include program efforts that promote maternal mental health in addition to family economic wellbeing, responsive caregiving, and child nutrition.","[Liu, Y.; Smith-Fawzi, M.

The prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders in adolescents is a growing public health concern worldwide. Given the high rates of drop-out and limited resources available in psychiatric settings, the importance of engaging adolescents in evidence-based treatments cannot be understated. The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI), as a brief pre-treatment intervention, to enhance treatment engagement in a standard therapy setting (group cognitive behavioral therapy; gCBT) for adolescents with anxiety and mood disorders. Method. Ninety-six adolescents (13-18 years) with a principal diagnosis of an anxiety or mood disorder participated in a trial conducted at two publicly funded outpatient services. Participants were randomly assigned to individual MI for treatment engagement prior to gCBT (MI + gCBT), or to an individually administered active control (befriending) prior to gCBT (befriending + gCBT). Eight pairs of gCBT were run in parallel. Outcome measures were the mean number of gCBT sessions attended, treatment initiation, and ratings of readiness for treatment. Results. Participants randomized to MI as a pretreatment intervention attended significantly more group therapy sessions compared to those in the active control condition. The MI group also demonstrated greater treatment initiation, and ratings of treatment readiness were significantly higher for those randomized to MI. Conclusions. MI, used as a pre-treatment intervention, enhanced group treatment engagement in adolescents diagnosed with anxiety and mood disorders compared to the active control condition. MI is a promising intervention to facilitate engagement in adolescent mental health settings.","[Dean, S.; Collings, S.] Univ Otago, Social Psychiat & Populat Mental Hlth Res Unit, Wellington, New Zealand; [Britt, E.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Psychol, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Bell, E.] Univ Otago, Dept Psychol Med, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bell, E.] Univ Otago, Rehabil Teaching & Res Unit, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stanley, J.] Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, Wellington, New Zealand","Dean, S (reprint author), Univ Otago, Social Psychiat & Populat Mental Hlth Res Unit, Deans Dept, Wellington, New Zealand.",shaystah.dean@postgrad.otago.ac.nz,,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0033-2917,1469-8978,2016,46,9,10.1017/s0033291716000568,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry; Psychology",Psychology; Psychiatry,WOS:000378716200014,1961-1969,Dean,S.,16-Jul,Dean_PsychMed_2016_bv722.pdf,Participants randomized to MI as a pretreatment intervention attended significantly more group therapy ses- sions compared to those in the active control condition,Participants randomized to MI as a pretreatment intervention attended significantly more group therapy ses- sions compared to those in the active control condition,0,1,1766,(x1: 105.11 y1: 368.09) (x2: 269.62 y2: 383.92),"Findings from this study demonstrate that MI, as a pre- treatment intervention for engagement, leads to greater mean attendance | compared with an active control (befriending)","Findings from this study demonstrate that MI, as a pre- treatment intervention for engagement, leads to greater mean attendance | compared with an active control (befriending)",0,6 | 6,1202 | 1403,(x1: 306.65 y1: 535.53) (x2: 377.82 y2: 564.95) | (x1: 461.71 y1: 571.53) (x2: 424.69 y2: 588.99),"Participants randomized to MI as a pre-treatment intervention attended signifi- cantly more therapy sessions (mean across group means = 4.0, range of group means 2.6–5.0) compared to those in the active control condition (mean across group means = 2.7, range of group means 1.8–4.1; mean difference = 1.3, 95% CI 0.4–2.2, t14 = 3.0, p = 0.010)","Participants randomized to MI as a pre-treatment intervention attended significantly more therapy sessions (mean across group means = 4.0, range of group means 2.6–5.0) compared to those in the active control condition (mean across group means = 2.7, range of group means 1.8–4.1; mean difference = 1.3, 95% CI 0.4–2.2, t_14 = 3.0, p = 0.010).",0,6,240,(x1: 191.06 y1: 523.45) (x2: 108.01 y2: 612.91),"mean difference = 1.3, 95% CI 0.4–2.2, t14 = 3.0, p = 0.010","mean difference = 1.3, 95% CI 0.4–2.2, t_14 = 3.0, p = 0.010",6,523,(x1: 72.62 y1: 595.45) (x2: 105.23 y2: 612.91),S.

The current pilot study examined whether parents who received worksite support for attendance at a school-based healthy weight program would attend more sessions, lose more weight, and make healthier changes in home food environments than parents who did not receive worksite support. Method: Thirty-eight urban, low-income African American and Mexican American mothers of kindergartners were randomized to an integrated school-parent-worksite program that targeted healthy home food environments and energy balance self-monitoring or the identical school-based program without worksite support. Ten sessions were delivered to parent participants during afterschool hours. Process measures included session attendance and energy balance log completion. Outcome measures included parent body mass index (BMI) change, child BMI z-score change, and home food inventory (HFI) score changes over 12 months. Results: Results showed better weight change for parents (i.e., BMI unit reduction of 1.4 vs. 0.3 in comparison group, p =.001), increased parental attendance, and improvements in the home food environment when parents received paid time off from their worksite for their participation in the healthy weight program. Child weight change was also observed despite no direct contact with children. Conclusions: The current pilot study provides support for the hypothesis that worksite support for school-based interventions may improve health outcomes that depend on parental involvement. Removing barriers to attendance in a healthy weight program resulted in improved treatment adherence and outcomes in low-income, minority parents and children.","[Anderson, Laura M.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Nursing, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Symoniak, Emilia D.] SUNY Buffalo, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Counseling Sch & Educ Psychol, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Epstein, Leonard H.] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Pediat, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA","Anderson, LM (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Nursing, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.",pulse@buffalo.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,2014,33,11,10.1037/hea0000007,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000344010300018,1421-1425,Anderson,Laura M.,14-Nov,Anderson_HealthPsych_2014_kk0vk.pdf,"Results showed better weight change for parents (i.e., BMI unit reduction of 1.4 vs. 0.3 in comparison group, p  .001) | when parents received paid time off from their worksite for their participation in the healthy weight program","Results showed better weight change for parents (i.e., BMI unit reduction of 1.4 vs. 0.3 in comparison group, p  .001) | when parents received paid time off from their worksite for their participation in the healthy weight program",0,1 | 1,1252 | 1449,(x1: 216.24 y1: 326.54) (x2: 284.72 y2: 341.00) | (x1: 230.77 y1: 346.54) (x2: 273.16 y2: 361.00),It was hypoth- esized that worksite support would positively influence | weight- related outcomes for parents,It was hypoth- esized that worksite support would positively influence | weight- related outcomes for parents,0,1 | 1,3987 | 4116,(x1: 491.49 y1: 681.57) (x2: 525.15 y2: 698.07) | (x1: 517.51 y1: 704.52) (x2: 415.29 y2: 721.00),"Analyses showed differential BMI change for parental BMI, F(1, 36)  8.17, p  .001 (Figure 1A), with greater decreases for PHWP-W than PHWP parents.

However, few studies have examined PTG among patients in active treatment for cancer. This study examined both positive and negative valenced change in PTG and relationships with treatment-related symptoms and mental and physical quality of life (QOL) among adults in active cancer treatment. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, adult outpatients (n = 114) completed a self-administered questionnaire. Hierarchical linear regression modeling (HLM) was performed to examine unique associations between positive and negative valenced change in PTG and QOL subscales and symptom reporting, controlling for theoretically relevant sociodemographic variables. Results: The majority of participants (87%) reported at least one positive life change, whereas half (50%) reported at least one negative life change across PTG items. In BLM analysis of QOL subscales, negative valence PTG scores were positively associated with Physical Functioning and Bodily Pain and inversely associated with General Health, Role Physical, and Mental Health (F(12, 71) = 5.13; p <.0001). In FILM analysis of treatment symptom burden, positive valence PTG scores were inversely associated with age at diagnosis and reports of nausea (F(8, 83) = 2.93; p =.007). Conclusions: Reports of positive and negative life changes since diagnosis are common among adults actively receiving treatment for cancer.

Design: A single-item measure of the perceived impact of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was embedded twice in a questionnaire battery completed by community-dwelling middle-aged males (N = 1,790). The impact measure was placed in two distinct questionnaire contexts; at the end of a general somatic symptoms questionnaire, and following an illness-specific symptoms questionnaire. The order of the two questionnaire contexts was counterbalanced in a random subsample. Main Outcome Measures: An established single-item measure of the perceived impact of LUTS. Results: Concordance between the two single-item measures was moderate. Scores on a single-item measure of impact were significantly lower when assessed immediately following the completion of a LUTS-specific questionnaire than when assessed following the completion of a general symptoms questionnaire. There was no evidence of order effects. The observed effect was moderated by the severity of LUTS such that the difference in perceived impact scores between contexts (where general symptoms context > illness-specific context) increased as urinary symptoms increased. Conclusion: Questionnaire context systematically influenced responses on self-report measures of illness impact. The magnitude of the context effect was largest in the highest quintile of LUTS severity, a difference of 0.5 on a scale with a range of 3. These findings may have implications for situations where patient reported outcome measures are used to evaluate health care interventions or inform treatment decisions.","[Cartwright, Martin] City Univ London, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Cartwright, Martin; Grunfeld, Elizabeth A.; Weinman, John] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Ogden, Jane] Univ Surrey, Dept Psychol, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Grunfeld, Elizabeth A.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Cartwright, M (reprint author), City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",martin.cartwright.1@city.ac.uk,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,2012,31,4,10.1037/a0026504,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000306386600018,534-538,Cartwright,Martin,12-Jul,Cartwright_HealthPsych_2012_1xp6z.pdf,The observed effect was moderated by the severity of LUTS such that the difference in perceived impact scores between contexts (where general symptoms context  illness-specific context) increased as urinary symptoms increased,The observed effect was moderated by the severity of LUTS such that the difference in perceived impact scores between contexts (where general symptoms context  illness-specific context) increased as urinary symptoms increased,0,1,1295,(x1: 154.26 y1: 325.54) (x2: 229.08 y2: 350.00),"questionnaire context, opera- tionalized as the immediately preceding survey items, influences responses on a measure of illness cognition","questionnaire context, opera- tionalized as the immediately preceding survey items, influences responses on a measure of illness cognition",0,3,3169,(x1: 440.44 y1: 228.98) (x2: 468.78 y2: 256.00),"a significant interaction between context and LUTS, F(1, 1787  142.63, p  .001,  2  .072","...a significant interaction between context and LUTS, F(1, 1787)=142.63, p<.001,  eta-squared= .072.",0,3,2891,(x1: 372.42 y1: 154.98) (x2: 488.06 y2: 171.00),"F(1, 1787  142.63, p  .001,  2  .072","F(1, 1787)=142.63, p <.001,  eta-squared = .072",3,2943,(x1: 333.48 y1: 166.05) (x2: 488.06 y2: 171.00),Martin Cartwright,martin.cartwright.1@city.ac.uk,1,9n1om

Method: This study focuses on 82 premutation carrier mothers (M age = 51.4 years; SD = 7.7) of adolescent and adult children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). A Gene x Environment interaction approach examined the ways in which the experience of negative life events interacts with genetic vulnerability to predict depressive symptoms, anxiety, and daily cortisol levels. Results: The associations of life events with all 3 dependent measures were associated with COG repeat length but in a curvilinear manner. Mothers with midsize COG repeats who experienced above-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had more depressive symptoms and anxiety and had a blunted cortisol awakening response, as compared with those with higher or lower repeat lengths. However, mothers with midsize COG repeats who experienced below-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had the lowest levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and they exhibited the typical cortisol response to awakening, meeting the criteria for differential susceptibility. Conclusions: This research extends our understanding of the phenotypic effects of the expansion of the FMR1 gene, and it adds to the growing literature on the curvilinear relationship between COG repeat length and mental and physical health.","[Seltzer, Marsha Mailick; Coe, Christopher] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Ctr, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Seltzer, Marsha Mailick; Greenberg, Jan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Social Work, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Almeida, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Seltzer, MM (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Ctr, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",mseltzer@waisman.wisc.edu,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P30 HD003100-S1]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Waisman Center [P30 HD03352],AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,2012,31,5,10.1037/a0026528,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000308509900009,612-622,Seltzer,Marsha Mailick,12-Sep,Seltzer_HealthPsych_2012_3b5r2.pdf,Mothers with midsize CGG repeats who experienced above-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had more depressive symptoms | as compared with those with higher | repeat lengths,Mothers with midsize CGG repeats who experienced above-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had more depressive symptoms | as compared with those with higher | repeat lengths,0,1 | 1 | 1,1015 | 1219 | 1263,(x1: 129.00 y1: 262.04) (x2: 270.27 y2: 276.50) | (x1: 458.54 y1: 272.04) (x2: 231.09 y2: 286.50) | (x1: 261.35 y1: 282.04) (x2: 304.34 y2: 286.50),we predicted that mothers with midsize CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene who reported a greater number of negative life events the previous year would be more likely than mothers with | higher number of repeats to expe- | rience depression,we predicted that mothers with midsize CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene who reported a greater number of negative life events the previous year would be more likely than mothers with | higher number of repeats to expe- | rience depression,0,2 | 2 | 3,6727 | 6924 | 0,(x1: 373.34 y1: 682.98) (x2: 353.92 y2: 721.00) | (x1: 421.00 y1: 715.98) (x2: 546.07 y2: 721.00) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 77.98) (x2: 113.49 y2: 83.00),Results | are presented in Table 1. | the interaction between negative life events and the curvilinear term for CGG repeats was also significant. | These interaction effects are depicted in Figure 1 | The figures reveal that premutation carrier mothers with midsize repeats who experienced the highest number of negative life events in the previous 12 months had elevated levels of depression,"Results...are presented in Table 1...the interaction between negative life events and the curvilinear term for CGG repeats was also significant...These interaction effects are depicted in Figure 1...The figures reveal that premutation carrier mothers with midsize repeats who experienced the highest number of negative life events in the previous 12 months had elevated levels of depression...[Table 1, Depressive symptoms, N = 82, CGG Repeat Length Squared X Total No. of negative life events in family = -.52, SE = 0.00, p < .05]",1,5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5,23 | 308 | 691 | 799 | 1389,(x1: 57.00 y1: 95.98) (x2: 83.50 y2: 101.00) | (x1: 114.28 y1: 139.98) (x2: 206.03 y2: 145.00) | (x1: 104.83 y1: 205.98) (x2: 248.17 y2: 222.00) | (x1: 57.00 y1: 227.98) (x2: 234.67 y2: 233.00) | (x1: 78.10 y1: 326.97) (x2: 86.49 y2: 364.99),Table 1 | Depressive symptoms | SE | CGG Repeat Length Squared  Total No. of negative life events in family | 0.00 | .52 | p  .05,"Table 1, Depressive symptoms, N = 82, CGG Repeat Length Squared X Total No. of negative life events in family = -.52, SE = 0.00, p < .05",5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5,4640,(x1: 48.00 y1: 504.47) (x2: 75.99 y2: 509.49) | (x1: 221.94 y1: 546.04) (x2: 293.04 y2: 550.50) | (x1: 253.04 y1: 573.10) (x2: 261.93 y2: 577.50) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 680.54) (x2: 161.29 y2: 694.00) | (x1: 250.48 y1: 689.54) (x2: 264.48 y2: 694.00) | (x1: 292.68 y1: 689.54) (x2: 302.68 y2: 694.00) | (x1: 93.99 y1: 716.60) (x2: 119.98 y2: 721.00),Marsha Mailick Seltzer,mseltzer@waisman.wisc.edu,1,j9n1j

The present study aims to evaluate whether the addition of an emotional education intervention component to a traditional social cognitive safer sex intervention increases intervention efficacy, compared with both a social cognitive only intervention and a no intervention control condition. Methods: Young adults were randomized in small groups to receive the social cognitive emotional (SCE) intervention, the social cognitive (SC) intervention, or standard of care. Results: Analyses of data from 176 participants indicated that intervention arms reported similar increased condom use compared with the no intervention control arm at 3 months' postintervention (beta = = .41, d = 0.08). However, at 6 months' postintervention, individuals in the SCE intervention arm reported increased condom use compared with both the SC intervention (beta = .27, p = .04, d = 0.38) and control arms (beta =.37, p < .01; d = 0.56), demonstrating preliminary evidence that the addition of an emotional education component may facilitate sustained behavior change.

Party members grant candidates greater leeway to accommodate competing policy demands when in government. The study tests the hypotheses using a new database of party congress speeches from Germany and France, and uses automated text classification to estimate speakers' relative preferences.

Specifically, they argue that European colonial powers engineered a global 'reversal of fortune', bringing property rights and prosperity to relatively uninhabited colonies while imposing inefficient institutions on locales with less potential for settlement. We re-evaluate their theoretical arguments and empirical findings and come to a different conclusion. We concur that British colonialism dramatically restructured four colonies, resulting in phenomenal economic success. For the majority of the world, however. colonialism had no discernible effect on property rights.

I show how these results lend support to theories of asymmetric information, capital bias, and regulatory capture as important sources of regulatory distortion.","Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Cicala, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",scicala@uchicago.edu,,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,2015,105,1,10.1257/aer.20131377,Economics,Business & Economics,WOS:000347464300014,411-444,Cicala,Steve,15-Jan,Cicala_AmEcoRev_2015_brvpk.pdf,I find that deregulated plants substantially reduce the price paid for coal,I find that deregulated plants substantially reduce the price paid for coal,0,1,424,(x1: 139.46 y1: 217.35) (x2: 159.13 y2: 235.40),I find that divested plants reduce the price paid for coal by 12 percent,I find that divested plants reduce the price paid for coal by 12 percent,0,2,3247,(x1: 117.92 y1: 578.89) (x2: 434.96 y2: 585.03),"Table 2 shows the change in log-price associated with plant divestiture using the matched DID estimator. | Taken together, these estimates show a 12–13 percent drop in the price that divested facilities have paid for coal relative to nearby generation stations that were similar both on the  characteristics | of the facility, coal, and trends before divestiture occurred.","Table 2 shows the change in log-price associated with plant divestiture using the matched DID estimator...Taken together, these estimates show a 12–13 percent drop in the price that divested facilities have paid for coal relative to nearby generation stations that were similar both on the characteristics of the facility, coal, and trends before divestiture occurred.

To guide empirical work, I introduce technology choice in a model of trade with heterogeneous firms. The joint treatment of the technology and exporting choices shows that the increase in revenues produced by trade integration can induce exporters to upgrade technology. An empirical test of the model reveals that firms in industries facing higher reductions in Brazil's tariffs increase investment in technology faster. The effect of tariffs is highest in the upper-middle range of the firm-size distribution, as predicted by the model.

This study examined whether adding an individualized motivational plan (IMP) to a standard BIP (SBIP) increased intervention effectiveness relative to BIP alone. Method: One hundred sixty males convicted of intimate partner violence were randomly assigned to receive 70 hr of either SBIP or SBIP plus IMP. The IMP is based on motivational interviewing, stages of change, and strength-based theory principles. We collected the data at baseline, at the end of the 9-month program and at 6-month follow-up. Final outcome was recidivism (recidivism data obtained from official databases, self-reported recidivism, and therapists' assessment of recidivism risk), and proximal outcomes included treatment compliance (dropout and intervention dose), and stage of change. We analyzed the results using both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approaches. Results: Findings indicated that the SBIP plus IMP participants received significantly more intervention dose (R-2 = .08), finished the intervention in a more advanced stage of change (ITT, R-2 = .17; PP, R-2 = .22), reported less physical violence after treatment (ITT, odds ratio = .63; PP, odds ratio = .34), and had a higher reduction in recidivism risk (ITT, R-2 = .64; PP, R-2 = .56) than SBIP participants. Conclusions: These results highlight the relevance of alternative approaches, including strategies to increase treatment compliance and motivation for change, in BIPs.","[Lila, Marisol; Gracia, Enrique; Catala-Minana, Alba] Univ Valencia, Dept Social Psychol, Ave Blasco Ibanez 21, Valencia 46010, Spain","Lila, M (reprint author), Univ Valencia, Dept Social Psychol, Ave Blasco Ibanez 21, Valencia 46010, Spain.",marisol.lila@uv.es,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-006X,1939-2117,2018,86,4,10.1037/ccp0000291,"Psychology, Clinical",Psychology,WOS:000429817100002,309-320,Lila,Marisol,18-Apr,Lila_JournConsClinPsy_2018_r38mz.pdf,Findings indicated that the SBIP plus IMP participants | reported less physical violence after treatment | than SBIP participants,Findings indicated that the SBIP plus IMP participants | reported less physical violence after treatment | than SBIP participants,0,1 | 1 | 1,1191 | 1393 | 1560,(x1: 129.00 y1: 282.54) (x2: 312.20 y2: 287.00) | (x1: 129.00 y1: 302.54) (x2: 278.59 y2: 307.00) | (x1: 344.37 y1: 312.54) (x2: 417.10 y2: 317.00),We hypothesized that participants assigned to SBIP plus IMP would present better final | outcomes | relative to SBIP alone condition participants,We hypothesized that participants assigned to SBIP plus IMP would present better final | outcomes | relative to SBIP alone condition participants,0,3 | 3 | 3,4179 | 4279 | 4368,(x1: 533.54 y1: 176.97) (x2: 373.70 y2: 203.99) | (x1: 426.27 y1: 198.97) (x2: 460.76 y2: 203.99) | (x1: 519.09 y1: 209.97) (x2: 439.48 y2: 225.99),"the analysis showed | A significant effect of treatment condition on | self-reported physical violence | (W  5.08; OR  .63; p  .05; 95% CI [.42, .94])","…the analysis showed…A significant effect of treatment condition on…self-reported physical violence (W = 5.08; OR = .63; p < .05; 95% CI [.42, .94])...",0,7 | 7 | 7 | 8,2847 | 2884 | 2993 | 0,(x1: 370.59 y1: 693.59) (x2: 442.32 y2: 698.61) | (x1: 499.43 y1: 693.59) (x2: 424.71 y2: 709.80) | (x1: 435.22 y1: 715.98) (x2: 546.04 y2: 721.00) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 207.48) (x2: 234.04 y2: 212.50),"W  5.08; OR  .63; p  .05; 95% CI [.42, .94]","W = 5.08, OR = .63, p < .05, 95% CI [.42, .94]",8,1,(x1: 51.00 y1: 207.55) (x2: 231.05 y2: 212.50),Marisol Lila,marisol.lila@uv.es,1,n34py

Method: We randomized 85 patients with pathological health anxiety into an electronic diary-based AMT group (AMTG; n = 42) and a control group without AMT (CG; n = 43). Self-report symptom measures, emotional evaluation, attentional bias, and memory bias toward symptom and illness words were assessed with an emotional Stroop task, a recognition task, and an emotional rating task for valence and arousal. Results: After the 2-week period, the AMTG compared with the CG reported lower symptoms of pathological health anxiety, F(1, 82) = 10.94, p < .01, eta(2)(p) = .12, rated symptom, F(1, 82) = 5.56, p = .02, eta(2)(p) = .06, and illness words, F(1, 82) = 4.13, p = .045, eta(2)(p) = .05, as less arousing, and revealed a smaller memory response bias toward symptom words in the recognition task F(1, 82) = 12.32, p < .01, eta(2)(p) = .13. However, no specific AMT effect was observed for the attentional bias.

We do so using an extensive, hand-collected data set on corporate hedging activities. Hedging can lower the odds of negative realizations, thereby reducing the expected costs of financial distress. In theory, this should ease a firm's access to credit. Using a tax-based instrumental variable approach, we show that hedgers pay lower interest spreads and are less likely to have capital expenditure restrictions in their loan agreements. These favorable financing terms, in turn, allow hedgers to invest more. Our tests characterize two exact channels-cost of borrowing and investment restrictions-through which hedging affects corporate outcomes. The analysis shows that hedging has a first-order effect on firm financing and investment, and provides new insights into how hedging affects corporate value. More broadly, our study contributes novel evidence on the real consequences of financial contracting.","[Campello, Murillo] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Campello, Murillo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lin, Chen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yue] Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zou, Hong] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Campello, M (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,WILEY-BLACKWELL,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,2011,66,5,10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01683.x,"Business, Finance; Economics",Business & Economics,WOS:000295098400005,1615-1647,Campello,Murillo,11-Oct,CAMPELLO_JournFinance_2011_r3dr6.pdf,hedging has a first-order effect on firm financing,hedging has a first-order effect on firm financing,0,1,928,(x1: 107.44 y1: 281.45) (x2: 287.69 y2: 286.29),Our evidence suggests that hedging reduces the cost of external financing,Our evidence suggests that hedging reduces the cost of external financing,0,3,700,(x1: 75.49 y1: 180.40) (x2: 405.01 y2: 186.45),"Our results are reported in Table III. | The estimates show a negative and statistically significant relation between hedging and the odds of having capital expenditure restrictions in loan agree- ments.

To explain this life cycle of diffusion across the international state system, we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic of diffusion for an innovation albeit here in the policy realm. In the first period, BITs provided a solution to the time inconsistency problem facing host governments and foreign investors. In the second period, these treaties became the global standard governing foreign investment. As the density of BITs among peer countries increased, more countries signed them in order to gain legitimacy and acceptance without a full understanding of their costs and competencies. More recently, as the potential legal liabilities involved in BIT signing have become more broadly understood, the pattern of adoption has reverted to a more competitive and rational logic. Our empirical tests of BIT signing over four decades provide evidence for such a three-stage model.","[Jandhyala, Srividya] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Henisz, Witold J.; Mansfield, Edward D.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Jandhyala, S (reprint author), George Washington Univ, 2201 G St NW,Funger Hall 401, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",srividya@gwu.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0027,1552-8766,2011,55,6,10.1177/0022002711414373,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000298354700008,1047-1073,Jandhyala,Srividya,11-Dec,Jandhyala_JournConflictRes_2011_6yd9g.pdf,we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic of diffusion for an innovation,we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic of diffusion for an innovation,0,1,502,(x1: 159.28 y1: 335.85) (x2: 156.86 y2: 352.75),The influence of the host country political system | on the likelihood of BIT signing between the home and host countries will be lower in the second stage as compared to the first,The influence of the host country political system | on the likelihood of BIT signing between the home and host countries will be lower in the second stage as compared to the first,0,11 | 11,2067 | 2160,(x1: 116.05 y1: 413.83) (x2: 315.81 y2: 418.44) | (x1: 164.36 y1: 425.80) (x2: 351.83 y2: 442.37),"we find that the difference in the levels of checks and balances between the home and host countries (measured by the difference in their POLCON scores) is positively related to the likelihood of BIT signing in the first | wave | during the second wave, this difference in POLCON scores is negatively related to the likelihood of BIT signing | Further, a chi-square test shows that we can reject the null hypothesis that the param- eter estimates are equal across the first and second waves (chi-square ¼ 10.22, df ¼ 1, p < .05)","...we find that the difference in the levels of checks and balances between the home and host countries (measured by the difference in their POLCON scores) is positively related to the likelihood of BIT signing in the first...wave...during the second wave, this difference in POLCON scores is negatively related to the likelihood of BIT signing...Further, a chi-square test shows that we can reject the null hypothesis that the parameter estimates are equal across the first and second waves (chi-square = 10.22, df = 1, p < .05)...",0,19 | 19 | 19 | 19,389 | 620 | 895 | 1119,(x1: 113.95 y1: 138.88) (x2: 342.99 y2: 167.35) | (x1: 48.64 y1: 174.71) (x2: 69.68 y2: 179.32) | (x1: 129.09 y1: 210.59) (x2: 261.53 y2: 227.16) | (x1: 48.64 y1: 246.48) (x2: 119.01 y2: 274.96),"chi-square ¼ 10.22, df ¼ 1, p < .05)","chi-square = 10.22, df = 1, p < .05",19,1267,(x1: 300.75 y1: 258.38) (x2: 119.01 y2: 274.96),Srividya Jandhyala,srividya@gwu.edu,1,6mq7r

With geographical cells of approximately 76 km(2) as units of analysis, we test how absolute and relative welfare affect the presence and number of conflict events during the 1989-2002 Liberian civil war. We control for neighboring conflict events, distance to Monrovia and national borders, population density, diamond deposits, and ethnic affiliations. War events were more frequent in the richer locations. This may provide better support for ""opportunity"" explanations than for ""relative deprivation"" theories of conflict, but we argue that the relative weakness of the Liberian government makes it difficult to distinguish between the two.","[Hegre, Havard; Ostby, Gudrun] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, Ctr Study Civil War, Int Peace Res Inst, Oslo, Prio, Norway; [Raleigh, Clionadh] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland","Hegre, H (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, Ctr Study Civil War, Int Peace Res Inst, Oslo, Prio, Norway.",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E007147/1],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0027,1552-8766,2009,53,4,10.1177/0022002709336459,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000267710200006,598-623,Hegre,Havard,9-Aug,Hegre_JournConflictRes_2009_xrz6r.pdf,War events were more frequent in the richer locations.,War events were more frequent in the richer locations.,0,1,1263,(x1: 156.53 y1: 412.87) (x2: 353.73 y2: 417.85),"Proposition 2: Independent of relative strength, the target value argument implies that the risk of conflict events increases with the level of socioeconomic wealth at the location.","Proposition 2: Independent of relative strength, the target value argument implies that the risk of conflict events increases with the level of socioeconomic wealth at the location.",0,7,2033,(x1: 60.00 y1: 437.95) (x2: 383.41 y2: 453.93),"In Table 1, we report the estimates from a zero-inflated negative binomial regres- sion model of the number of conflict events in each grid cell, controlling for these factors. | in model 2 | In the “war events” equation, only the wealth index estimate is significant. | the more assets the local population possess on average, the more frequent are conflict events.","In Table 1, we report the estimates from a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model of the number of conflict events in each grid cell, controlling for these factors...in model 2...In the “war events” equation, only the wealth index estimate is significant…the more assets the local population possess on average, the more frequent are conflict events.

Self-determination theory posits that intrinsic motivation develops through the interaction of the person and the environment. The present study investigated how elementary school students' motivation develops over the course of a school year in Japanese public schools. Five-hundred and fifteen Japanese elementary school children were surveyed over the course of one school year. Self-reported motivation, perceptions of teacher support, need satisfaction, and engagement were measured at different times. External raters observed students' engagement, while classroom teachers assessed the quality of students' motivation and learning. Structural equation modeling results indicated a positive, dynamic relationship between motivation, perceptions of the learning environment, and engagement. External raters' assessments showed significant positive correlations with students' self-reported engagement. Findings indicate how the instruction offered in these Japanese elementary schools supported students' foreign language learning motivation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These studies have led to deeper theoretical understanding, but their reliance on self-report data limit the conclusions that can be drawn. We employed a behavioral approach instead and assessed learning processes by logging learners' behaviors as they used educational technology. We examined the relationship between achievement goals, strategy use, and comprehension scores of 160 undergraduates who studied a hypertext passage in a technology-enhanced learning environment (TELE) equipped with tools that support learning behaviors including highlighting, taking notes, review of annotations, seeking additional information and monitoring understanding. Results of a path analysis indicated that higher mastery goals predicted more information-seeking and note-taking and marginally more monitoring of learning. Performance avoidance goals negatively predicted note-taking and information-seeking. Performance approach goals did not predict the behaviors we traced. Of the behaviors we traced, highlighting and monitoring predicted increases in comprehension scores. A behavioral approach to assessing learning processes confirmed only a subset of paths from achievement goals to learning processes to learning outcomes originally discovered with self-report data.

We develop a structural model to analyze more than 3,000 drug research and development projects advanced to preclinical and clinical trials in the United States between 1980 and 1994. Key to our approach is careful attention to the issue of selection. Firms choose which compounds to advance into clinical trials. This choice depends not only on the technical promise of the compound, but also on commercial considerations such as the expected profitability of the market or concerns about product cannibalization. After controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more innovative than newly entered biotech firms; (b) older biotech firms display selection behaviors and innovation performances similar to established pharmaceutical firms; and (c) compounds licensed during preclinical trials are as likely to succeed as internal compounds of the licensor, which is inconsistent with the ""lemons"" hypothesis in technology markets.","[Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Arora, Ashish] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Univ Bocconi, Dept Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Univ Bocconi, KITeS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Magazzini, Laura] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Pammolli, Fabio] Fdn CERM, I-00187 Rome, Italy; [Pammolli, Fabio] IMT Lucca Inst Adv Studies, I-55100 Lucca, Italy","Arora, A (reprint author), Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ashish.arora@duke.edu; alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it; laura.magazzini@univr.it; pammolli@gmail.com,"Italian Ministry of Education; CNR-ESF Project ""Science and Technology in Large and Small Firms,""; Bocconi University",INFORMS,"7240 PARKWAY DR, STE 310, HANOVER, MD 21076-1344 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,2009,55,10,10.1287/mnsc.1090.1055,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,WOS:000270527900003,1638-1653,Arora,Ashish,9-Oct,Arora_ManagementSci_2009_p7652.pdf,"After controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more innovative than newly entered biotech firms;","After controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more innovative than newly entered biotech firms;",0,2,1509,(x1: 210.12 y1: 379.36) (x2: 530.51 y2: 395.24),Hypothesis 4′ .

One explanation for these low-to-moderate associations is the assumption that teacher and student ratings are not perfectly stable over time. By using a manifest-latent state-trait model, the present study investigated the following topics in a sample of 5th-grade students (74 classes) from vocational track schools: (a) the time consistency of teacher and student instructional quality ratings in math lessons over multiple measurement time points; (b) the agreement among teachers and students for time consistent rating components and single time point ratings; and (c) the predictive power of consistent rating components and single time point ratings with regard to a standardized math achievement test, and math self-concept. Results of multilevel factor analyses with 3 measurement time points over a period of 3 months showed a moderate-to-high time consistency for both teacher and student ratings. Furthermore, the agreement among teacher and student ratings regarding classroom management and goal clarity was higher for the consistent rating components than for ratings at single measurement time points, whereas this pattern was not found for support of autonomy. Finally, student consistent rating components predicted students' pretest adjusted math achievement and self-concept. The effect sizes for ratings at single measurement time points varied within quality dimensions.","[Wagner, Wolfgang; Goellner, Richard; Werth, Sarah; Voss, Thamar] Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Europastr 6, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Schmitz, Bernhard] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Psychol, Darmstadt, Germany","Wagner, W (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Europastr 6, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany.",wolfgang.wagner@uni-tuebingen.de,"German Research Foundation (DFG); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts in Baden-Wurttemberg",AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-0663,1939-2176,2016,108,5,10.1037/edu0000075,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000383099100008,705-721,Wagner,Wolfgang,16-Jul,Wagner_JournEduPsych_2016_7d69v.pdf,student consistent rating components predicted students’ pretest adjusted math achievement,student consistent rating components predicted students’ pretest adjusted math achievement,0,1,1794,(x1: 278.35 y1: 373.04) (x2: 241.29 y2: 387.50),We expected that consistent rat- ing components would reveal a higher predictive power on stu- dents’ math achievement | at single measurement time points,We expected that consistent rat- ing components would reveal a higher predictive power on stu- dents’ math achievement | at single measurement time points,0,4 | 4,989 | 1143,(x1: 169.67 y1: 242.98) (x2: 141.76 y2: 269.99) | (x1: 281.57 y1: 264.97) (x2: 164.48 y2: 280.99),"The results for math achievement (see Table 6) | When controlling for the pretest (t1 achievement as covariate) | With regard to the association between student ratings and achievement, the time-consistent components were found to be predictive","The results for math achievement (see Table 6)...When controlling for the pretest (t_1 achievement as covariate)...With regard to the association between student ratings and achievement, the time-consistent components were found to be predictive…[Table 6, Pretest adjustment (t_1), Student, Classroom Management, Time Consistent, beta = .36, SE = .14, p < .01 (one-tailed test)]",0,10 | 10 | 10,2052 | 2315 | 2620,(x1: 466.91 y1: 375.82) (x2: 404.67 y2: 392.15) | (x1: 482.60 y1: 421.09) (x2: 465.58 y2: 437.43) | (x1: 315.00 y1: 489.00) (x2: 342.00 y2: 516.66),"Table 6 | Pretest adjustment (t1) | Student | SE p | Classroom management | Time-consistent | .36 .14

Causal interpretations of how self-interest, values, and welfare state attitudes are linked have been difficult to sustain so far, as the research mainly relies on static, cross-sectional analyses. We address this empirical challenge using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel (2008-2013) that covers the period of the international economic crisis. We investigate how individuals change their attitudes in times of economic hardship. Our findings confirm theoretical expectations that people change their support for unemployment benefits in reaction to changes in their individual material circumstances. Job loss leads to an increased support for public provision of unemployment benefits. The analysis also suggests that this attitude change is persistent. After the temporarily unemployed have found a new job, they do not return to their pre-unemployment attitude. In contrast, individual support for life course-related domains of the welfare state such as health care or pensions is not affected by changes in individual material circumstances. Our results show that individual material circumstances and thus self-interest have a sizable effect on how individuals change their welfare state attitudes.","[Naumann, Elias; Baehr, Johannes] Univ Mannheim, Collaborat Res Ctr SFB Polit Econ Reforms 884, L 13 17, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Buss, Christopher] Univ Mannheim, Grad Sch Econ & Social Sci, L 9 7, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany","Naumann, E (reprint author), Univ Mannheim, Collaborat Res Ctr SFB Polit Econ Reforms 884, L 13 17, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",naumann@uni-mannheim.de,German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 884],OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2016,32,1,10.1093/esr/jcv094,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000374479000007,81-92,Naumann,Elias,16-Feb,Naumann_EurSocioRev_2016_d63bv.pdf,Our findings confirm theoretical expectations that people change their support for unemployment benefits in reaction to changes in their individual material circumstances.,Our findings confirm theoretical expectations that people change their support for unemployment benefits in reaction to changes in their individual material circumstances.,0,1,1162,(x1: 142.13 y1: 358.92) (x2: 442.99 y2: 375.48),"a change in material circumstances leads to a change in welfare support (H1).

Although research indicates that the job insecurity construct has cognitive (i.e., the perceived negative change to one's job) and affective (i.e., the emotional reactions to the potential change to one's job) components, scholars rarely apply this distinction between cognitive and affective job insecurity in their conceptualization and theory development. On the basis of 535 independent samples, a meta-analysis in Study 1 found that (1) job insecurity was significantly related to 51 out of 56 outcomes and correlates; (2) affective job insecurity had stronger relations with the majority of outcomes and correlates than did cognitive job insecurity as well as explained valid, unique variance in outcomes and correlates above and beyond cognitive job insecurity; and (3) in most cases, affective job insecurity mediated the relationships between cognitive job insecurity and its outcomes. Furthermore, Study 2 examines a moderator that may explain why individuals with the same level of cognitive job insecurity may display different levels of affective job insecurity. Specifically, we found a stronger relationship between cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity among individuals with high work centrality with two samples. Overall, results demonstrate that it is empirically meaningful to treat cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity as two separate constructs and that affective job insecurity is more closely related to employee outcomes than is cognitive job insecurity. Future research could further assess affective job insecurity and continue to explore moderators and mediators in the cognitive job insecurity-affective job insecurity relationship.","[Jiang, Lixin] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lavaysse, Lindsey M.] Washington State Univ, Vancouver, WA USA","Jiang, LX (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",l.jiang@auckland.ac.nz,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1347973],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0149-2063,1557-1211,2018,44,6,10.1177/0149206318773853,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Business & Economics; Psychology,WOS:000433285200005,2307-2342,Jiang,Lixin,18-Jul,Jiang_JournManage_2018_yzppl.pdf,we found a stronger relationship between cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity among individuals with high work centrality,we found a stronger relationship between cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity among individuals with high work centrality,0,1,1568,(x1: 163.68 y1: 430.07) (x2: 335.04 y2: 446.05),Hypothesis 4: Work centrality moderates the relation between CJI and AJI in that the relation between CJI and AJI is stronger for those with high work centrality compared to those with low work centrality.,Hypothesis 4: Work centrality moderates the relation between CJI and AJI in that the relation between CJI and AJI is stronger for those with high work centrality compared to those with low work centrality.,0,24,2642,(x1: 62.00 y1: 466.65) (x2: 130.40 y2: 493.63),"As can be seen in Figure 2, CJI had a stronger relation with AJI (Sample A: b = 0.84, SE = 0.10, | p < .001, 95% CI = [0.64, 1.05] | for those with high work centrality | Thus, the moderating effect was significant | although the 95% CI around the simple slopes slightly over- lapped.

The robustness of these results was supported through replication in a lagged, correlation field study of employees in the production facility of a global company. In addition, in the field study, there was a significant additive component in the effects for promotion-oriented coaching, due to better regulatory fit for employees with incremental beliefs.","[Sue-Chan, Christina] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wood, Robert E.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Latham, Gary P.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Sue-Chan, C (reprint author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",csuechan@cityu.edu.hk,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0149-2063,1873-7978,2012,38,3,10.1177/0149206310375465,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Business & Economics; Psychology,WOS:000302365100004,809-835,Sue-Chan,Christina,12-May,Sue-Chan_JournManage_2012_8gby4.pdf,a promo- tion coaching orientation relative to a prevention coaching orientation had a more positive effect on the performance of recipients following coaching.,a promo- tion coaching orientation relative to a prevention coaching orientation had a more positive effect on the performance of recipients following coaching.,0,1,325,(x1: 373.13 y1: 355.69) (x2: 277.30 y2: 382.67),Hypothesis 1: Coaching framed with a promotion or prevention regulatory focus is positively related to performance,Hypothesis 1: Coaching framed with a promotion or prevention regulatory focus is positively related to performance,0,5,3118,(x1: 62.00 y1: 494.95) (x2: 128.54 y2: 510.92),"The main | effects predicted in Hypotheses 1 | were initially tested through a 2 × 2 ANOVA. | The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for coaching ori- entation.

However, whether novices' cognitive engagement should be augmented by behavioral engagement during multimedia learning is controversial. We find support for both stances in the literature: high cognitive engagement and high cognitive plus-behavioral engagement. We investigated the effectiveness of two types of prompts corresponding to these stances. Study 1 (44 8th-graders) tested a group with think prompts versus a group with think-and-do prompts, whereas Study 2 (94 8th-graders) aimed to additionally investigate whether prompts per se revealed an effect. Although prompts prolonged learning time, think prompts promoted knowledge acquisition. Our findings show that learners who engaged in cognitive activity outperformed those who were prompted for cognitive and behavioral engagement. Pure cognitive engagement benefited retention, transfer, and the retrieval of information focused by prompts.

Based on two longitudinal cohorts (Grades 2 -5; Grades 4-7), latent growth models were used to analyze the development of achievement emotions and coping strategies separately as well as simultaneously. The results show that enjoyment decreases across grades, whereas boredom increases, with substantial changes between Grade 5 and Grade 7. Consistently, the development of enjoyment is positively associated with the development of problem focused coping and palliative emotion regulation, whereas the development of boredom is positively associated with the development of avoidant coping and anger-related emotion regulation. Moreover, the relation between problem-focused coping and boredom, as well as between avoidant coping and enjoyment, depends on the age group. The results are discussed regarding the organization of learning environments in classes to prevent unfavorable developmental patterns of achievement emotions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study tested whether phasic changes in blink rate could provide an index of reward pursuit. This hypothesis was tested in people with bipolar I disorder (BD; a population with aberrations in reward responsivity) and in those without BD. A total of 31 adults with BD and 28 control participants completed a laboratory task involving effort toward monetary reward. Blink rate was recorded using eye tracking at baseline, reward anticipation, and postreward. Those in the BD group completed self-report measures relating to reward and ambition. Results showed that across all participants, blink rates increased from reward anticipation to postreward. In the BD group, reward-relevant measures were strongly correlated with variation in blink rate. These findings provide validation for phasic changes in blink rate as an index of reward response.","[Peckham, Andrew D.; Johnson, Sheri L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Peckham, AD (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",adpeckham@berkeley.edu,National Institute of Mental Health [T32-MH089919],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2167-7026,2167-7034,2016,4,3,10.1177/2167702615594999,"Psychology, Clinical",Psychology,WOS:000408534000007,451-463,Peckham,Andrew D.,16-May,Peckham_ClinPsychSci_2016_by2r9.pdf,blink rates increased from reward anticipation to postreward,blink rates increased from reward anticipation to postreward,0,1,3685,(x1: 278.73 y1: 341.65) (x2: 540.46 y2: 347.15),We hypothesized that eye-blink rate should increase during anticipation of reward.,We hypothesized that eye-blink rate should increase during anticipation of reward.,0,2,4467,(x1: 359.88 y1: 394.52) (x2: 480.01 y2: 412.02),"Planned contrasts showed that eye-blink rate | significantly increased from the reward anticipation phase to the reward receipt phase, F(1, 57) = 4.35, p = | .04, ηp 2 = .07","Planned contrasts showed that eye-blink rate…significantly increased from the reward anticipation phase to the reward receipt phase, F(1, 57) = 4.35, p = .04, partial eta squared = .07.",0,7 | 7 | 7,2482 | 2655 | 2765,(x1: 48.00 y1: 658.52) (x2: 244.13 y2: 664.02) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 694.52) (x2: 292.49 y2: 712.02) | (x1: 310.50 y1: 408.83) (x2: 370.80 y2: 414.33),"F(1, 57) = 4.35, p = | .04, ηp 2 = .07","F(1, 57) = 4.35, p = .04, partial eta squared = .07",7 | 7,2743,(x1: 206.07 y1: 706.48) (x2: 292.49 y2: 712.02) | (x1: 310.50 y1: 408.83) (x2: 370.80 y2: 414.33),Andrew Peckham,adpeckham@berkeley.edu,1,w68yd

Drawing on the appropriability literature, we argue that the inclusion of a grantback clause in technology licensing agreements is an attempt to balance the gains from and protection of the focal firms' technologies. We hypothesize that the closer the licensed technology is to the licensor's core patented technologies, the more likely the licensing agreement will include a grant-back clause, while the closer the licensed technology is to the licensee's core patent portfolio, the less likely the agreement will include a grant-back clause. We hypothesize also that technological uncertainty is a positive moderator in the decision to include a grant-back clause, if the licensed technology is close to either the licensee's or the licensor's core technologies. We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 397 licensed technologies. This method allows us to model the choice to include a grant-back clause as nested in the decision about which technologies to license out.

But research on this process has yet to fully account for two critical realities underscored by recent research: (1) firms need to acquire resources from different groups of resource providers and (2) reputation is multidimensional. Drawing on the organizational reputation literature and on information processing theory, we propose that two groups of resource providers will respond differently to new firms' affiliations in accordance with differences in the groups' abilities to recognize and interpret reputation-related signals. We also propose that within a single group of resource providers, distinct characteristics of the affiliate will exert different influences. We test these propositions using longitudinal data from Belgian firms that affiliated with venture capital (VC) investors. Consistent with our predictions, we find that characteristics of a VC affiliate exert more influence on prospective financiers than on prospective employees. We further find that prospective financiers were more influenced by a VC's industry-specific experience than by its media prominence, whereas prospective employees were more influenced by a VC's media prominence than by its industry-specific experience. Taken together, the findings show that new firms' resource attraction trajectories are shaped by their affiliates in more complex ways than past research has accounted for.","[Vanacker, Tom] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vanacker, Tom] Vlerick Business School, Ghent, Belgium; [Forbes, Daniel P.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Vanacker, T (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.; Vanacker, T (reprint author), Vlerick Business School, Ghent, Belgium.",tomr.vanacker@ugent.be; forbe010@umn.edu,Hercules Foundation [AUGE/11/13]; Research Foundation Flanders [FWO11/PDO/076]; Richard M.

This study focuses on depressive symptoms and measures accessed occupational status. Results are consistent with the selfevaluation motive explanation.

In four experiments we manipulate consumption goals, controlling for the outcomes, the option valence, and whether the externally made choice was determined by an expert or at random. Results show that the outcome of a self-made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian. We hypothesize that this effect results from the greater perceived personal causality associated with terminally motivated activities, such as hedonic choices, relative to instrumentally motivated activities, such as utilitarian choices, and provide evidence that supports this explanation over alternative accounts.","[Botti, Simona] London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England; [McGill, Ann L.] Univ Chicago Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Botti, S (reprint author), London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",sbotti@london.edu; ann.mcgill@chicagobooth.edu,,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,2011,37,6,10.1086/656570,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000297840400010,1065-1078,Botti,Simona,11-Apr,Botti_JournConsRes_2011_jbr01.pdf,Results show that the outcome of a self- made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian.,Results show that the outcome of a self- made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian.,0,1,794,(x1: 410.87 y1: 338.59) (x2: 464.17 y2: 361.13),we predict that the difference in perceived causality experienced by choosers and nonchoosers should be reduced in the context of instrumentally motivated versus terminally motivated choices.,we predict that the difference in perceived causality experienced by choosers and nonchoosers should be reduced in the context of instrumentally motivated versus terminally motivated choices.,0,4,848,(x1: 123.19 y1: 240.90) (x2: 173.58 y2: 279.64),"The 2 (choice) # 2 (goal) ANOVA on participants’ liking of their own con- dition revealed a main effect for choice (F(1, 115) p 135.90, p ! .0001) | Participants liked their decision process more in the choice | and hedonic | conditions than those in the no choice | and utilitarian | conditions did.","The 2 (choice) x 2 (goal) ANOVA on participants’ liking their own condition revealed a main effect for choice (F(1, 115) = 135.90, p < .0001)...Participants liked their own decision process more in the choice...and hedonic...conditions than those in the no choice...and utilitarian...conditions did.

Previous research has shown that conceptual priming can lead people to disclose sensitive information (Davis, Soref, Villalobos, & Mikulincer, 2016; Dawson, Hartwig, & Brimbal, 2015). Here, we sought to examine whether concepts of openness can be activated to promote disclosure within the interview itself, through the physical setting. In two laboratory studies, participants were exposed to details of a mock environmental terrorism conspiracy through a courier task, which they were subsequently interviewed about in different settings. In Study 1, participants were interviewed in either a room designed to activate openness, or a prototypically enclosed, bare custodial interview room. In Study 2, we manipulated both architectural and interior features of both rooms. Challenging the status quo that a small room is optimal for investigative interviewing, our findings offer compelling evidence that the spaciousness of an interview room can influence a person's tendency to be ""open"" with or ""closed"" about information.","[Dawson, Evan; Hartwig, Maria; Brimbal, Laure; Denisenkov, Philipp] CUNY, John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Dawson, E (reprint author), John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Psychol, 524 West,59th St, New York, NY 10019 USA.",edawson@jjay.cuny.edu,High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group [J-FBI-12-193]; John Jay College of Criminal Justice,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0147-7307,1573-661X,2017,41,4,10.1037/lhb0000244,"Law; Psychology, Social",Government & Law; Psychology,WOS:000406109000002,333-343,Dawson,Evan,17-Aug,Dawson_LawHuman_2017_q784g.pdf,the spaciousness of an interview room can influence a person’s tendency to be “open” with or “closed” about information.,the spaciousness of an interview room can influence a person’s tendency to be “open” with or “closed” about information.,0,1,1268,(x1: 212.03 y1: 282.54) (x2: 270.95 y2: 297.00),Hypothesis 3: Participants interviewed in an open setting will disclose more information than participants interviewed in a custodial setting.,Hypothesis 3: Participants interviewed in an open setting will disclose more information than participants interviewed in a custodial setting.,0,2,4407,(x1: 322.00 y1: 299.30) (x2: 383.75 y2: 326.24),"partic- ipants who were interviewed in the open setting provided signif- icantly more overall details about the plot (range: 0–19.5, M  8.0, SD  6.2) than those who were interviewed in the custodial setting (range: 0–16.5, M  5.3, SD  5.3), t(110)  2.446, p  .02, d  .46, 95% CI [.09, .84].","participants who were interviewed in the open setting provided significantly more overall details about the plot (range: 0–19.5, M = 8.0, SD = 6.2) than those who were interviewed in the custodial setting (range: 0–16.5, M = 5.3, SD = 5.3), t(110) = 2.446, p = .02, d  = .46, 95% CI [.09, .84].",0,5,1211,(x1: 264.56 y1: 304.97) (x2: 170.66 y2: 364.99),"t(110)  2.446, p  .02, d  .46, 95% CI [.09, .84]","t(110) = 2.446, p = .02, d = .46, 95% CI [.09, .84]",5,1452,(x1: 213.26 y1: 349.05) (x2: 168.41 y2: 364.99),Evan Dawson,edawson@jjay.cuny.edu,1,vd675

When eyewitnesses provide a verbal expression of confidence about a lineup identification, such as I'm fairly certain it's him, how well do others understand the intended meaning of this statement of confidence? And, how is this perception of the meaning influenced by justifications of the level of confidence, such as when eyewitnesses say, I remember his chin? The answers to these questions are unknown, as there is no research on how others interpret the intended meaning of eyewitness confidence. Three experiments show that an additional justification of confidence, relative to seeing a confidence statement alone, can increase misunderstanding in others' estimation of the meaning of the expression of confidence. Moreover, this justification-induced increase in misunderstanding only occurs when the justification refers to an observable facial feature and not when it refers to an unobservable quality (e.g., He is very familiar). Even more noteworthy, both Experiments 2 and 3 show that this featural justification effect is strongest when eyewitnesses express absolute certainty in an identification, such as by stating I am positive. When a highly confident assertion is accompanied by a featural justification others will be most likely to misinterpret the intended meaning.","[Dodson, Chad S.; Dobolyi, David G.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Dodson, CS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",cdodson@virginia.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0147-7307,1573-661X,2015,39,3,10.1037/lhb0000120,"Law; Psychology, Social",Government & Law; Psychology,WOS:000355838800006,266-280,Dodson,Chad S.,15-Jun,Dodson_LawHuman_2015_jwp5g.pdf,"an additional justification of confidence, relative to seeing a confidence statement alone, can increase misunderstanding in others’ estimation of the meaning of the expression of confidence.","an additional justification of confidence, relative to seeing a confidence statement alone, can increase misunderstanding in others’ estimation of the meaning of the expression of confidence.",0,1,770,(x1: 162.92 y1: 242.54) (x2: 465.02 y2: 257.00),"The primary hypothesis we tested is that justifications of eyewitness expressions of confidence will cause greater variability among participants about the intended numeric meaning of the expression of confidence, relative to when a confidence statement occurs in isolation.","The primary hypothesis we tested is that justifications of eyewitness expressions of confidence will cause greater variability among participants about the intended numeric meaning of the expression of confidence, relative to when a confidence statement occurs in isolation.",0,2,5472,(x1: 341.01 y1: 429.97) (x2: 375.74 y2: 478.99),"There were signif- | icant main effects of | Justification Presence, F(1, 516.6)  43.98, p  .001,  p 2  .08","There were significant main effects of… Justification Presence, F(1, 516.6) = 43.98, p < .001,  partial eta squared =  .08...",0,5 | 5 | 5,2283 | 2302 | 2328,(x1: 223.86 y1: 462.97) (x2: 288.07 y2: 467.99) | (x1: 306.00 y1: 77.97) (x2: 378.01 y2: 82.99) | (x1: 392.65 y1: 77.97) (x2: 374.91 y2: 94.00),"F(1, 516.6)  43.98, p  .001,  p 2  .08","F(1, 516.6) = 43.98, p < .001,  partial eta squared =  .08.",5,2352,(x1: 472.36 y1: 78.04) (x2: 374.91 y2: 94.00),Chad S.

Do these sources of bias impact legal decisions, which are frequently made by people subject to factors that have been proposed to reduce bias (training and accountability)? To answer the question, we examined the potential for 3 major social-psychological theories of gender bias (role-congruity theory, ambivalent sexism, and implicit bias) to predict outcomes of labor arbitration decisions. In the first study, undergraduate students and professional arbitrators made decisions about 2 mock arbitration cases in which the gender of the employee-grievants was experimentally manipulated. Student participants' decisions showed the predicted gender bias, whereas the decisions of experienced professionals did not. Individual-level attitudes did not predict the extent of the observed bias and accountability did not attenuate it. In the second study, arbitrators' explicit and implicit gender attitudes were significant predictors of their decisions in published cases. The laboratory and field results suggest that context, expertise, and implicit and explicit attitudes are relevant to legal decision-making, but that laboratory experiments alone may not fully capture the nature of their effect on legal professionals' decisions in real cases.","[Girvan, Erik J.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Deason, Grace] Univ Wisconsin, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Borgida, Eugene] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Girvan, EJ (reprint author), 1221 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",girvan@uoregon.edu,National Academy of Arbitrators Research and Education Foundation; American Psychology - Law Society; Center for the Study of Political Psychology at the University of Minnesota; Leverhulme Grant [IN-058],AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0147-7307,1573-661X,2015,39,5,10.1037/lhb0000139,"Law; Psychology, Social",Government & Law; Psychology,WOS:000361231500009,525-537,Girvan,Erik J.,15-Oct,Girvan_LawHuman_2015_ogzmz.pdf,arbitrators | implicit gender attitudes were significant predictors of their decisions in published cases.,arbitrators | implicit gender attitudes were significant predictors of their decisions in published cases.,0,1 | 1,1284 | 1310,(x1: 429.48 y1: 311.54) (x2: 462.35 y2: 316.00) | (x1: 168.21 y1: 321.54) (x2: 450.74 y2: 326.00),Hypothesis 3: Participants who have relatively positive im- plicit associations with | women | will tend to favor | female | employee-grievants in their arbitration decisions,Hypothesis 3: Participants who have relatively positive im- plicit associations with | women | will tend to favor | female | employee-grievants in their arbitration decisions,0,4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4,406 | 496 | 503 | 528 | 536,(x1: 64.00 y1: 172.15) (x2: 147.58 y2: 188.10) | (x1: 171.64 y1: 183.08) (x2: 198.14 y2: 188.10) | (x1: 203.92 y1: 183.08) (x2: 267.78 y2: 188.10) | (x1: 67.00 y1: 194.08) (x2: 91.49 y2: 199.10) | (x1: 97.00 y1: 194.08) (x2: 272.56 y2: 199.10),"Simple-slopes analysis showed that, when the grievant was female, | implicit attitudes toward women were | significant (   0.68, CI[ 1.16,  .19], p  .006) negative predictors of upholding the termination decision","Simple-slopes analysis showed that, when the grievant was female,… implicit attitudes toward women were…significant (beta =  -0.68, CI[ -1.16,  -.19], p = .006) negative predictors of upholding the termination decision… ",0,8 | 8 | 8,5116 | 5204 | 5318,(x1: 315.00 y1: 385.98) (x2: 332.74 y2: 402.00) | (x1: 424.99 y1: 396.98) (x2: 323.49 y2: 413.00) | (x1: 377.41 y1: 418.98) (x2: 543.79 y2: 435.00),"0.68, CI[ 1.16,  .19], p  .006","beta =  -0.68, CI[ -1.16,  -.19], p = .006",8,5334,(x1: 445.61 y1: 418.98) (x2: 321.75 y2: 435.00),Erik J.

While research acknowledges that frontline employees (FLEs) constitute, through service encounters, a key interface for the transfer of valuable external knowledge into the firm, the range of potential benefits derived from FLE-driven innovation deserves more investigation. Using a sample of knowledge intensive business services firms (KIBS), this study examines how the collaboration with FLEs along the new service development (NSD) process, namely FLE co-creation, impacts on service innovation performance following two routes of different effects. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) results indicate that FLE co-creation benefits the NS success among FLEs and firm's customers, the constituents of the resources route. FLE co-creation also has a positive effect on the NSD speed, which in turn enhances the NS quality. NSD speed and NS quality integrate the operational route, which proves to be the most effective path to impact the NS market performance. Accordingly, KIBS managers must value their FLEs as essential partners to achieve successful innovation from an internal and external perspective, and develop the appropriate mechanisms to guarantee their effective involvement along the NSD process.","[Leticia Santos-Vijande, Maria] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Empresa, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain; [Angel Lopez-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Extremadura, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Avda Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain; [Rudd, John] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Aston Triangle, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England","Santos-Vijande, ML (reprint author), Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Empresa, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",lsantos@uniovi.es; jangel@unex.es; j.m.rudd@aston.ac.uk,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-31300],SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0092-0703,1552-7824,2016,44,3,10.1007/s11747-015-0447-4,Business,Business & Economics,WOS:000377378200007,350-375,Leticia Santos-Vijande,Maria,16-May,Santos-Vijande_JournAcaMarkSci_2016_jryxz.pdf,"FLE co-creation also has a positive effect on the NSD speed, which in turn enhances the NS qual- ity.","FLE co-creation also has a positive effect on the NSD speed, which in turn enhances the NS qual- ity.",0,1,1271,(x1: 145.24 y1: 471.44) (x2: 62.98 y2: 501.72),H6: FLE co-creation directly and positively affects NSD speed.,H6: FLE co-creation directly and positively affects NSD speed.,0,9,3251,(x1: 306.17 y1: 210.35) (x2: 354.52 y2: 228.16),"Regarding the operational route (H6 | ) | , we confirmed that FLE co-creation has a positive and significant effect on NSD speed (H6: path coefficient=0.221; t-statistic= 2.500; p<0.05).","Regarding the operational route (H6...)..., we confirmed that FLE co-creation has a positive and significant effect on NSD speed (H6: path coefficient = 0.221; t-statistic= 2.500; p<0.05).",0,17 | 17 | 17,109 | 147 | 158,(x1: 62.36 y1: 534.15) (x2: 210.36 y2: 539.54) | (x1: 227.45 y1: 534.15) (x2: 230.66 y2: 539.54) | (x1: 271.37 y1: 534.15) (x2: 113.63 y2: 576.90),(H6: path coefficient=0.221; t-statistic= 2.500; p<0.05).,H6: path coefficient = 0.221; t-statistic= 2.500; p<0.05,17,245,(x1: 133.24 y1: 559.04) (x2: 113.63 y2: 576.90),Maria Leticia Santos-Vijande,lsantos@uniovi.es,1,vno1y

In addition, there may be situations in which trust can develop with lesser degrees of any of the trustworthiness facets or propensity to trust. Hence, we apply a configurational set-theoretic perspective to examine what combinations will be sufficient to produce the presence of trust in a direct supervisor across nascent and established relationships. We find three distinct configurations associated with trust in supervisor, which allows us to elaborate theory and provide novel insights to trust research. In particular, we find that in both nascent and established relationships, perceptions of high supervisor ability, benevolence, and integrity constitute a sufficient configuration for high trust in supervisor. In established relationships, however, there were two paths to high trust in supervisor: (i) perceptions of high supervisor ability and integrity, or (ii) perceptions of high supervisor ability and benevolence, accompanied by high propensity to trust. As such, in established relationships, perceptions of high supervisor benevolence and high propensity to trust may be substitutable with perceptions of high supervisor integrity.

From 14 to 18 years old, however, the late-onsetters showed a higher rate of increase in drinking, compared with the persisters and desisters. Starting at 18 years of age, the desisters drinking trajectory started to resemble that of the nonviolent group, who showed the highest rate of increase in drinking during emerging adulthood. By 24/25 years of age, the persisters could not be distinguished from the late-onsetters, but they were lower than the nonviolent and one-timer groups in terms of their drinking. At 24/25 years old, the desisters were not significantly different from the other violence groups, although they seemed most similar to the nonviolent and one-timer groups. We found no evidence that the association between drinking and violence differed for African Americans and Caucasians. The findings suggest that yearly changes in alcohol use could provide important clues for preventing violent offending.","[White, Helene R.; Lee, Chioun] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Alcohol Studies, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [White, Helene R.; Lee, Chioun] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Sociol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Loeber, Rolf] Univ Pittsburgh, Western Psychiat Inst & Clin, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Mun, Eun-Young] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","White, HR (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Alcohol Studies, 607 Allison Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",hewhite@rci.rutgers.edu,"NIDA NIH HHS [R01 DA011018, P20 DA017552]; NIAAA NIH HHS [R01 AA016798, R01 AA019511]; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH073841, P30 MH079920]",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0011-1384,1745-9125,2012,50,2,10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00263.x,Criminology & Penology,Criminology & Penology,WOS:000302353300004,391-426,White,Helene R.,12-May,WHITE_Criminology_2012_ozbmw.pdf,The persisters | reported the highest levels of drinking at 13 years of age.,The persisters | reported the highest levels of drinking at 13 years of age.,0,2 | 2,317 | 346,(x1: 151.12 y1: 128.34) (x2: 210.38 y2: 134.08) | (x1: 271.92 y1: 128.34) (x2: 209.87 y2: 146.04),We hypothesize that persisters will drink more than other youth during adolescence,We hypothesize that persisters will drink more than other youth during adolescence,0,8,2074,(x1: 188.83 y1: 429.27) (x2: 231.64 y2: 447.08),"We created dummy variables for the violence groups and regressed them onto the growth parameters (see table 2). | At 13 years of age, the persisters showed significantly higher levels of alcohol use, compared with all other groups except desisters.","We created dummy variables for the violence groups and regressed them onto the growth parameters (see table 2)...At 13 years of age, the persisters showed significantly higher levels of alcohol use, compared with all other groups except desisters.

To address these issues, we measure respondent delinquency and peer delinquency with illegal substance use and then decompose the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use. Logistic hierarchical models on a sample of adolescents from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) indicate that the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use is partially mediated by perceptions of the health risks of substance use. In addition, the direct statistical effect of peers is nonlinear: On average, the peer effect decreases at higher values of peer substance use, which is consistent with a saturation effect. We also find that the functional form of the peer substance use/substance use relationship is dependent on the neighborhood context. In neighborhoods with more opportunities for crime, the peer effect is initially strong but decreases as peer substance use increases, which is consistent with a saturation effect. Conversely, in neighborhoods with fewer opportunities for crime, the effect of peers is initially small, but as delinquent peer associations increase, the peer effect increases multiplicatively.","[Zimmerman, Gregory M.] Northeastern Univ, Sch Criminol & Criminal Justice, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Vasquez, Bob Edward] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Criminal Justice, San Marcos, TX USA","Zimmerman, GM (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Criminol & Criminal Justice, 204 Churchill Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",G.Zimmerman@neu.edu,,WILEY-BLACKWELL,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0011-1384,1745-9125,2011,49,4,10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00244.x,Criminology & Penology,Criminology & Penology,WOS:000298060600010,1235-1273,Zimmerman,Gregory M.,11-Nov,ZIMMERMAN_Criminology_2011_o8b3r.pdf,the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use is partially mediated by perceptions of the health risks of substance use.,the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use is partially mediated by perceptions of the health risks of substance use.,0,1,1056,(x1: 146.81 y1: 422.72) (x2: 107.76 y2: 452.36),The perceived harm of substance use should partially mediate the relationship between peer substance use and self-reported substance use.,The perceived harm of substance use should partially mediate the relationship between peer substance use and self-reported substance use.,0,9,1941,(x1: 98.90 y1: 412.85) (x2: 115.78 y2: 442.61),The Sobel test indicates that the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use is significantly mediated by the perceived harm of substance use (z = 2.21; p < .05).,The Sobel test indicates that the effect of peer substance use on self-reported substance use is significantly mediated by the perceived harm of substance use (z = 2.21; p < .05).,0,22,1567,(x1: 121.99 y1: 386.40) (x2: 225.46 y2: 416.16),z = 2.21; p < .05,z = 2.21; p < .05,22,1727,(x1: 149.28 y1: 410.42) (x2: 219.10 y2: 416.16),GREGORY M.

Parents' number of children is instrumented with the sex mix of their first two children. We find that having additional children causes sizable reductions in labor supply for women, which fade as children mature and even turn positive for women without a college degree. Among women with a college degree, there is evidence of persistent and even increasing career penalties of family size.

Although migration may be a risk factor for HIV infection, I instead focus on the possibility that the HIV positive are more likely to migrate. Using a longitudinal data set of permanent rural residents and migrants from Malawi, I find that migrants originating from rural areas are indeed more likely than nonmigrants to be HIV positive and to have engaged in HIV risk behaviors. The increased HIV risk among migrants may be due to the selection of HIV-positive individuals into migration; I find that HIV-positive individuals are more likely to migrate than those who are HIV negative. The explanation for this phenomenon appears to be marital instability, which occurs more frequently among HIV-positive individuals and leads to migration after marital change.","Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Syst & Dev, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA","Anglewicz, P (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Syst & Dev, 1440 Canal St,Suite 2200, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",panglewi@tulane.edu,"NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG012836, P30 AG12836]; NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD041713, R01 HD050142, R01-HD37276, R01 HD053781, R01-HD050142, R01-HD/MH-41713-0, R01 HD044228, R01 HD037276, T32 HD007242, R01-HD044228-01]",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0070-3370,1533-7790,2012,49,1,10.1007/s13524-011-0072-x,Demography,Demography,WOS:000300065100011,239-265,Anglewicz,Philip,12-Feb,Anglewicz_Demography_2012_d2bvy.pdf,I find that migrants originating from rural areas are indeed more likely than nonmigrants to be HIV positive,I find that migrants originating from rural areas are indeed more likely than nonmigrants to be HIV positive,0,1,692,(x1: 112.35 y1: 330.62) (x2: 238.63 y2: 347.98),I begin by confirming that HIV prevalence is higher among migrants than nonmigrants in Malawi.,I begin by confirming that HIV prevalence is higher among migrants than nonmigrants in Malawi.,0,3,2752,(x1: 62.36 y1: 478.65) (x2: 148.74 y2: 496.00),"Figure 1 displays highly significant differences in HIV prevalence between MDICP migrants and nonmigrants, for both men and women.

These offsetting conditions obscure the net effects of immigration for welfare states. This article explores whether immigration's effects are mediated by the economic and social integration of immigrants. Integration can be conceptualized and measured as involving the degree to which immigrants suffer unemployment rates, depend on welfare-state benefits, and harbor social attitudes similarly to the native population. Such integration may alter how immigration reduces solidarity and imposes fiscal and macroeconomic pressures, but does not much alter how immigration spurs economic risks for natives. Where migrants are more integrated by such measures, immigration should have less negative or more positive implications for native support for government redistribution and welfare states than where migrants are less integrated. The article explores these arguments using survey data for twenty-two European countries between 2002 and 2010. The principal finding is that economic integration, more than sociocultural integration, softens the tendency of immigration to undermine support for redistributive policies.","[Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Burgoon, Brian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Burgoon, B (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.m.burgoon@uva.nl,,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0043-8871,1086-3338,2014,66,3,10.1017/s0043887114000100,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000339685200001,365,Burgoon,Brian,14-Jul,Burgoon_WorldPolitics_2014_v51dp.pdf,The principal finding is that economic integration | softens the tendency of immigration to undermine support for redistributive policies,The principal finding is that economic integration | softens the tendency of immigration to undermine support for redistributive policies,0,1 | 1,3982 | 4071,(x1: 159.31 y1: 39.31) (x2: 244.89 y2: 41.97) | (x1: 310.48 y1: 39.31) (x2: 62.80 y2: 45.97),"gaps in unemployment (for example, higher unemployment rates than natives) should enhance the degree to which immigration decreases, and/or diminish the degree to which immigration increases, native support for government redistribution.","gaps in unemployment (for example, higher unemployment rates than natives) should enhance the degree to which immigration decreases, and/or diminish the degree to which immigration increases, native support for government redistribution.",0,10,1417,(x1: 192.88 y1: 315.16) (x2: 302.41 y2: 353.87),table 1 summarizes the baseline results focused on Support redistribu- tion. | models 2 | directly test hypotheses 1 | suggesting that the economic nonintegration measures particularly di- minish the degree to which Foreign-born percent has a negative effect. this can be seen by the significant interaction terms in model 2 for interaction with Gap in unemployment (hypothesis 1)," Table 1 summarizes the baseline results focused on Support redistribution...Models 2...directly test hypotheses...suggesting that the economic nonintegration measures particularly diminish the degree to which Foreign-born percent has a negative effect.

Politicized agencies are slower to respond to requests even when controlling for agency size and workload. There is little evidence, however, that these agencies are more likely to respond poorly when they do respond.

Third-party regulatory designs introduce complexity and potentially conflicting incentives that can impact program delivery. This article examines how regulatory program outputs are shaped by third-party administrators through an investigation of the organizations charged with administering US organic food regulations. Based on the notion that third-party arrangements draw attention to administrator organizational characteristics, the article asks: To what extent does sector (public, nonprofit, for-profit) affect third-party administrators' regulatory approaches in the administration of uniform regulatory standards? A secondary analysis explores an economic facet of dimensional publicness among nonprofit third-party administrators. The study draws on regulatee survey data and uses multilevel analysis to account for how regulatory approaches vary across third-party administrator characteristics, as well as according to respondent-level attributes. The findings indicate that little systematic variation in regulatory approaches can be attributed to administrator sector. The facet of regulatory approach in which sector appears to play a role is found in public third-party regulatory organizations' lower provision of technical assistance, when compared to their for-profit counterparts.

Multiple experiments have shown that relative performance information influences citizens' evaluations of local services. It is unclear whether this information leads citizens to update their beliefs or temporarily employ different criteria, however, and we do not know if the influence of performance information will extend to contexts in which citizens have access to other information sources. We examine these questions using two experiments within nationally representative surveys. In the first, we find that providing respondents with information about the performance of their local schools relative to schools in the state, the nation, and other developed countries depresses average evaluations of local school quality. The second experiment shows that relative performance information depresses average evaluations in part by priming respondents to consider how the academic performance of their communities' schools compares to others, but also by leading some respondents with erroneous prior beliefs about school performance to update their beliefs.","[Barrows, Samuel] Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Henderson, Michael] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Peterson, Paul E.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [West, Martin R.] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA USA","Barrows, S (reprint author), Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",samuel_barrows@hks.harvard.edu,William Simon Foundation; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1053-1858,1477-9803,2016,26,3,10.1093/jopart/muw028,Political Science; Public Administration,Government & Law; Public Administration,WOS:000384895400012,571-583,Barrows,Samuel,16-Jul,Barrows_JournPubAdRes_2016_4p20n.pdf,we find that providing respondents with information about the performance of their local schools relative to schools in | other developed countries depresses average evaluations of local school quality.,we find that providing respondents with information about the performance of their local schools relative to schools in | other developed countries depresses average evaluations of local school quality.,0,1 | 1,1318 | 1465,(x1: 203.87 y1: 389.73) (x2: 289.03 y2: 407.12) | (x1: 399.22 y1: 401.73) (x2: 321.23 y2: 419.12),We expect information about the relative academic performance of local schools to influence citizens’ eval- uations of those schools.,We expect information about the relative academic performance of local schools to influence citizens’ eval- uations of those schools.,0,3,2762,(x1: 306.64 y1: 210.28) (x2: 416.23 y2: 240.14),"Informing respondents of local school performance relative to | internationally depresses the probabil- ity of assigning local schools A or B by approximately | 11 percentage points | Likelihood ratio tests confirm that these treatment effects are statistically significant (table 1, Rows | 3)","Informing respondents of local school performance relative to...internationally depresses the probability of assigning local schools A or B by approximately...11 percentage points...Likelihood ratio tests confirm that these treatment effects are statistically significant (table 1, Rows...3).

We analyze linked employer-employee data of a sample of 5,097 employees in 97 large German organizations and focus on first- and second-generation immigrants. We explore how generational status in the labor market and workplace contexts expands and contracts native-immigrant wage inequalities. We find a substantial average first-generation immigrant-native wage gap, which is not explained by individual human capital differences or most aspects of organizational context. In contrast, there is, on average, no second-generation wage gap, but there are substantial variations across workplaces. A series of results confirm predictions from relational inequality theory. For both first- and second-generation immigrants, working in a high-inequality workplace is associated with larger wage gaps. Second-generation immigrants perform better in workplaces where they have intersectional advantages over natives, and for first-generation immigrants collective bargaining protection narrows wage gaps with natives. Consistent with ethnic competition theory, in workplaces with very high shares of immigrant workers, the first-generation-native wage gap is larger. In contrast, increased contact between native Germans and second-generation immigrant coworkers reduces earnings gaps, but only up to a tipping point, after which competition processes reappear and earning gaps widen.","[Melzer, Silvia Maja; Jacobebbinghaus, Peter] Univ Bielefeld, Fac Sociol, Bielefeld, Germany; [Tomaskovic-Devey, Donald] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Sociol, Amherst, MA USA; [Schunck, Reinhard] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany","Melzer, SM (reprint author), Bielefeld Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",Silvia.Melzer@uni-bielefeld.de,German Research Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,2018,97,1,10.1093/sf/soy021,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000443579600018,91-127,Melzer,Silvia Maja,18-Sep,Melzer_SocialForces_2018_5kg09.pdf,We find a substantial average first-generation immigrant-native wage gap,We find a substantial average first-generation immigrant-native wage gap,0,1,1282,(x1: 102.51 y1: 272.84) (x2: 393.81 y2: 278.99),"H2a.

Moreover, the children of highly educated parents experience a two times larger 'separation penalty' than the children of less educated parents. We find a similar pattern of heterogeneity in effects for the likelihood of participation in academic education (A-Levels) beyond school leaving age but not for school grades at age 16. We test three different explanations for heterogeneity in the parental separation penalty: changes in family relations, changes in income, and negative selection into separation based on unobserved characteristics. We address the potential endogeneity of parental separation by including pre-separation observable characteristics, individual fixed effects models, and a placebo test. Our key finding is that changes in family income, but not those in family relations or selection, explain a large part of heterogeneity in the effects of parental separation. Children with more highly educated parents face a larger decline in family income if parents separate and, in addition, declines in family income of equal amounts entail more negative consequences for their educational attainment.","[Bernardi, Fabrizio; Boertien, Diederik] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy","Boertien, D (reprint author), European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",diederik.boertien@eui.eu,European Union [320116],OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2016,32,6,10.1093/esr/jcw036,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000397304800009,807-819,Bernardi,Fabrizio,16-Dec,Bernardi_EurSocioRev_2016_9wk59.pdf,We use the British Cohort Study 1970 to show that the proportion of children achieving a tertiary edu- cation degree is 8 percentage points lower for the offspring of separated parents than for children from intact families,We use the British Cohort Study 1970 to show that the proportion of children achieving a tertiary edu- cation degree is 8 percentage points lower for the offspring of separated parents than for children from intact families,0,1,445,(x1: 54.65 y1: 306.94) (x2: 136.30 y2: 335.51),"we have shown for the 1970 British birth cohort that the children of separated parents have, on average, an 8 percentage point lower probability of obtaining a tertiary education qualification by age 30.","we have shown for the 1970 British birth cohort that the children of separated parents have, on average, an 8 percentage point lower probability of obtaining a tertiary education qualification by age 30.",0,10,767,(x1: 230.57 y1: 491.93) (x2: 143.78 y2: 542.90),"Table 2 shows the effects of parental separation on the educational attainment of respondents at age 30 (Model

For instance, uprisings have repeatedly been preceded by forms of political liberalization that have provided greater opportunities ( the so- called Tocqueville paradox). In organizations, satisfaction with regard to promotion opportunities can be negatively associated with objective chances of promotion. Raymond Boudon has proposed a game- theoretic competition model, which specifies the micro- mechanisms that produce these puzzling phenomena at the aggregate level and clarifies the conditions under which they emerge. We conducted three laboratory experiments to test the model's predictions, making our study the first empirical test of Boudon's model. The results are mixed: when opportunities increased, the rate of the relatively frustrated losers in the group remained constant, or increased only slightly. However, when applying another aggregation rule, which accounts for all social comparison processes and does not merely focus on the losers, an increase in relative frustration under improved conditions was observed. Our results imply that under specific conditions, there is a trade- off between opportunities and social mobility, on the one hand, and social inequality and relative frustration, on the other.","[Berger, Joel; Diekmann, Andreas] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Berger, J (reprint author), ETH, Clausiusstr 50, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",joel.berger@soz.gess.ethz.ch,"ETH Zurich, Chair of Sociology",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2015,31,6,10.1093/esr/jcv071,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000367198400006,725-737,Berger,Joel,15-Dec,Berger_EurSocioRev_2015_k9yr6.pdf,"when applying another aggregation rule, which accounts for all social comparison processes and does not merely focus on the losers, an increase in relative frustration under improved conditions was observed","when applying another aggregation rule, which accounts for all social comparison processes and does not merely focus on the losers, an increase in relative frustration under improved conditions was observed",0,1,1309,(x1: 461.61 y1: 373.09) (x2: 98.03 y2: 413.68),"In short, the model predicts an inverse U-shaped path of aggregate relative frustra- tion when opportunities increase.","In short, the model predicts an inverse U-shaped path of aggregate relative frustra- tion when opportunities increase.",0,2,2677,(x1: 162.94 y1: 613.31) (x2: 185.36 y2: 640.58),"In Experiment 2, the Gini rises significantly (P¼ 0.006), from 0.106 (predicted: 0.098) in the low-mobility condition to 0.140 (predicted: 0.142) in the medium-mobility condition | However, when not merely focusing on the losers, and accounting for all comparison processes between losers, sustainers, and winners, an increase in relative frustra- tion is observed. | See Table A2 in the Appendix and OSD for further details of our analyses of Gini coefficients and the variance","In Experiment 2, the Gini rises significantly (P = 0.006), from 0.106 (predicted: 0.098) in the low-mobility condition to 0.140 (predicted: 0.142) in the medium-mobility condition...However, when not merely focusing on the losers, and accounting for all comparison processes between losers, sustainers, and winners, an increase in relative frustration is observed...See Table A2 in the Appendix and OSD for further details of our analyses of Gini coefficients and the variance.

Using comprehensive Norwegian administrative data on birth cohorts 1965-1982, this article examines whether second-generation immigrants experience disadvantages in access to employment and advantaged occupational positions compared to native peers with similar educational qualifications and social origins (N = 107,362). The results show that non-European ethnic minorities experience weaker labour market attachments relative to the native majority. Once employment is secured, however, there is no evident pattern of ethnic disadvantage in access to advantaged occupational positions.

The study aimed to disentangle the effects of age, aging, and cohort on volunteering among the young old. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, we examined volunteering rates of young olds (N = 2,745) in two decades: those being 55-69 years old in 1992 and their age-peers in 2002. Six-year follow-up on both cohorts allowed for cohort-sequential analyses. Multilevel logistic regression analyses revealed that (i) regardless of age, the 2002 cohort volunteered more often than the 1992 cohort, (ii) in 6 years' time volunteering increased for the 55- to 59-year-olds, stabilized among the 60- to 64-year-olds, and declined among the 65- to 69-year-olds, and (iii) these age-differential changes were observed in both cohorts. These effects remained significant after adjusting for gender, education, religious involvement, health, employment status, network size, and partner status. A higher education, religious involvement, staying in good health, and maintaining a large network increased the likelihood of volunteering. Unobserved factors, such as a more positive view on aging within society, may also account for the large increase in volunteering among the recent cohort of young olds.","[van Groenou, Marjolein Broese; van Tilburg, Theo] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","van Groenou, MB (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",mi.broese@fsw.vu.nl,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2012,28,1,10.1093/esr/jcq043,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000299747000001,11-Jan,van Groenou,Marjolein Broese,12-Feb,Broese van Groenou_EurSocioRev_2012_p7rbk.pdf,"regardless of age, the 2002 cohort volunteered more often than the 1992 cohort","regardless of age, the 2002 cohort volunteered more often than the 1992 cohort",0,1,750,(x1: 132.21 y1: 322.88) (x2: 478.73 y2: 327.45),It is hypothesized that persons in the recent cohort (2002) volunteer more often compared to their age-peers in the early cohort (1992) (H2a),It is hypothesized that persons in the recent cohort (2002) volunteer more often compared to their age-peers in the early cohort (1992) (H2a),0,4,501,(x1: 63.50 y1: 164.12) (x2: 219.30 y2: 190.66),"Model 2 in Table 2 shows that the 2002 cohort is more likely to volunteer than the 1992 cohort (OR¼ 1.36), which corroborates our hypothesis 2a."," Model 2 in Table 2 shows that the 2002 cohort is more likely to volunteer than the 1992 cohort (OR = 1.36), which corroborates our hypothesis 2a.

We find that people with disabilities have lower employment rates than persons without disabilities in nine countries. Across countries, disability gaps in employment rates are more often found for men than women. The largest disability gap in employment rates is found for persons with multiple disabilities.

By focusing on turnover intentions, this article develops propositions about why employees anticipate leaving their jobs along three dimensions: (1) demographic factors, (2) workplace satisfaction factors, and (3) organizational/relational factors. Two distinct measures of turnover intention are advanced that reflect those who intend to leave their agency for another position within the federal government and those who intend to leave the federal government for an outside position. The 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey is used to test the impacts of three clusters of independent variables on these measures of turnover intention. The findings suggest that overall job satisfaction and age affect turnover consistently.

Parents were then asked to coach their children to lie during subsequent interviews occurring 1 week later. Children were interviewed over 3 consecutive days. Results indicated that verbal expressive markers (e. g., cognitive operations, spontaneous corrections, admissions of lack of knowledge, temporal markers) of true and intentionally false reports were different in the first interview.

To understand these differences, we take a network approach to examine the mechanisms responsible for similarities (i.e., homophily) in violent offending and violent victimization among friends. Our goal is to determine whether the social network mechanisms that produce homophily for violent offending are similar to or different from those that produce homophily for violent victimization. By using stochastic actor-oriented modeling and two waves of friendship network data for 1,948 respondents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we examine homophily mechanisms of preference for similarity, avoidance, and influence with respect to youth violence and victimization. The results demonstrate that homophily observed for violent offending primarily reflects selection of similar others, whereas homophily observed for victimization reflects the tendency among alters to avoid victimized youth. These findings have important implications for future research and suggest that, among adolescents, violent offending and victimization homophily are the result of unique social processes.","[Turanovic, Jillian J.] Florida State Univ, Coll Criminol & Criminal Justice, Eppes Hall,112 S Copeland St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Young, Jacob T.

To address this issue, we draw on an emerging body of work that stresses the role of home mortgage lending-a resource secured via interaction with external actors-in reducing neighborhood violence and extend it by addressing concerns that the lending-violence relationship is spurious and confounded by simultaneity. We explore the longitudinal relationship between residential mortgage lending and violence in Seattle with a pooled time series of 118 census tracts over 27 years, and we instrument our endogenous predictors (home mortgage lending and violent crime) with changes in their levels from prior periods. Employing Arellano-Bond difference models, we assess both the effect of mortgage lending on violent crime as well as the effect of violent crime levels on mortgage activity.

Most researchers, however, have focused on unidimensional rather than multidimensional conceptualizations of self-esteem. The paucity of empirical research is surprising given conflicting theoretical perspectives on the stability of self-esteem. The goal of the present study was to thoroughly disentangle different conceptualizations of self-esteem and test opposing classical theories on (i) the stability and (ii) the direction of mutual influence of these different forms of self-esteem. We analysed two-year longitudinal data from participants (N=644 at T1, N=241 at T2) with an average age of 47.0years (SD=12.4). Analyses using a latent variable approach revealed that the domains of self-esteem were relatively stable in terms of rank order and mean levels. In fact, the size of the stability coefficients was comparable to that of other trait measures that have been reported in the literature and paralleled the stability observed for global self-esteem. Results did not provide support for either top-down or bottom-up effects between domain-specific and global self-esteem. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications regarding the stability and development of self-esteem in adulthood and advance the understanding of self-esteem in personality theory.

A cluster-randomized field experiment in 52 predominantly Hispanic elementary schools in San Antonio, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, tested whether student mobility in early elementary school was reduced through Families and Schools Together (FAST), an intervention that builds social capital among families, children, and schools.

The final sample included 7 treatment schools (n = 44 students) and 6 control schools (n = 26 students). Results of multilevel models showed that students with externalizing behavior in the treatment schools had significantly lower levels of problem behavior than those in the control schools. A positive but statistically nonsignificant treatment trend was observed for increased on-task behavior. No effects were observed for academic skills. The positive effects of the behavior intervention were smaller in schools serving higher proportions of students with low socioeconomic status and for students who had higher baseline levels of externalizing behavior.

Therefore, we sought to identify psychosocial determinants of optimal adherence, including adherence self-efficacy and outcome expectancies, with the aim of informing interventions designed to improve adherence among PWUD. Method: From December 2005 to November 2013, we collected data from the AIDS Care Cohort to evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS), a prospective cohort of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis to identify longitudinal factors independently associated with 95% or greater adherence to ART. Results: Among 667 participants, including 220 (33%) women, 391 (59%) had 95% or greater ART adherence at baseline. In multivariable GEE analysis, adherence self-efficacy, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.11, 1.21] per 10-point increase, was independently and positively associated with adherence, while negative outcome expectancy, AOR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.93, 0.98], was negatively associated. Conclusion: In light of the ongoing challenges associated with ART adherence among HIV-positive PWUD, and our findings of associations between adherence, self-efficacy, and outcomes expectancies, tailored intervention strategies based on constructs of social learning theory should be implemented and evaluated to improve adherence among HIV-infected PWUD.","[Lee, William K.; Milloy, M.

Design: Observational cohort of ambulatory patients with stable CHD. The authors measured self-efficacy using a published, validated, 5-item summative scale, the Sullivan Self-Efficacy to Maintain Function Scale. The authors also performed a cardiac assessment, including an exercise treadmill test with stress echocardiography. Main Outcome Measures: Hospitalizations for HF, as determined by blinded review of medical records, and all-cause mortality, with adjustment for demographics, medical history, medication use, depressive symptoms, and social support. Results: Of the 1,024 predominately male, older CHD patients, 1013 (99%) were available for follow-up, 124 (12%) were hospitalized for HF, and 235 (23%) died during 4.3 years of follow-up. Mean cardiac self-efficacy score was 9.7 (SD 4.5, range 0-20), corresponding to responses between ""not at all confident"" and ""somewhat confident"" for ability to maintain function. Lower self-efficacy predicted subsequent HF hospitalization (OR per SD decrease = 1.4, p = .0006), and all-cause mortality (OR per SD decrease = 1.4, p < .0001). After adjustment, the association of cardiac self-efficacy with both HF hospitalization and mortality was explained by worse baseline cardiac function. Conclusion: Among patients with CHD, self-efficacy was a reasonable proxy for predicting HF hospitalizations. The increased risk of HF associated with lower baseline self-efficacy was explained by worse cardiac function. These findings indicate that measuring cardiac self-efficacy provides a rapid and potentially useful assessment of cardiac function among outpatients with CHD.","[Sarkar, Urmimala; Whooley, Mary A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ali, Sadia; Whooley, Mary A.] San Francisco VA Med Ctr, Gen Internal Med Sect, San Francisco, CA USA","Sarkar, U (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Box 1732, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",urmimalasarkar@yahoo.com,National Research Service Awards [1 T32 HP19025]; Department of Veterans Affairs; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; American Federation for Aging Research; Ischemia Research and Education Foundation; Nancy Kirwan Heart Research Fund,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,2009,28,2,10.1037/a0013146,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000264326300004,166-173,Sarkar,Urmimala,9-Mar,Sarkar_HealthPsych_2009_5p57k.pdf,"Lower self-efficacy predicted subsequent HF hospitalization (OR per SD decrease  1.4, p  .0006),","Lower self-efficacy predicted subsequent HF hospitalization (OR per SD decrease  1.4, p  .0006),",0,1,1550,(x1: 190.99 y1: 358.14) (x2: 182.39 y2: 372.60),Low self-efficacy was associated with worse baseline cardiac function and with increased risk of HF hospitalizations in 1024 | ambulatory patients with CHD.,Low self-efficacy was associated with worse baseline cardiac function and with increased risk of HF hospitalizations in 1024 | ambulatory patients with CHD.,0,4 | 4,1203 | 1328,(x1: 57.68 y1: 704.08) (x2: 288.71 y2: 720.10) | (x1: 306.68 y1: 77.08) (x2: 421.87 y2: 82.10),"With stepwise adjustment for demographics, medical history, medication use, and psychosocial factors, self-efficacy remained independently predictive of heart failure hospitalization | (see Table 2).","With stepwise adjustment for demographics, medical history, medication use, and psychosocial factors, self-efficacy remained independently predictive of heart failure hospitalization...(see Table 2).

Four studies using this approach (involving nearly 1,800 participants) led to 3 basic sets of findings. First, when testing goals and reasons separately, mastery (-approach) goals and autonomous reasons explained variance in beneficial experiential (interest, satisfaction, positive emotion) and self-regulated learning (deep learning, help-seeking, challenging tasks, persistence) outcomes. Second, when testing goals and reasons simultaneously, mastery goals and autonomous reasons explained independent variance in most of the outcomes, with the predictive strength of each being diminished. Third, when testing goals, reasons, and goal complexes together, the autonomous mastery goal complex explained incremental variance in most of the outcomes, with the predictive strength of both mastery goals and autonomous reasons being diminished. Comparable results were observed for performance (-approach) goals, the autonomous performance goal complex, and performance goal-relevant outcomes. These findings suggest that achievement goals and reasons are both distinct and overlapping constructs, and that neither unilaterally eliminates the influence of the other. Integrating achievement goals and reasons offers the most promising avenue for a full account of competence motivation.","[Sommet, Nicolas; Elliot, Andrew J.] Univ Rochester, Dept Clin & Social Sci Psychol, Rochester, NY USA; [Sommet, Nicolas] Univ Lausanne, ISS, SSP, LINES, Batiment Geopolis,Bur 5785, Lausanne, Switzerland","Sommet, N (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, ISS, SSP, LINES, Batiment Geopolis,Bur 5785, Lausanne, Switzerland.",nicolas.sommet@unil.ch,"postdoctoral UNIL/CHUV fellowship (University of Lausanne, Switzerland)",AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-0663,1939-2176,2017,109,8,10.1037/edu0000199,"Psychology, Educational",Psychology,WOS:000415164600006,1141-1162,Sommet,Nicolas,17-Nov,Sommet_JournEduPsych_2017_5k91g.pdf,"when testing goals and reasons separately, mastery (-approach) goals | explained variance in beneficial experiential (interest | outcomes","when testing goals and reasons separately, mastery (-approach) goals | explained variance in beneficial experiential (interest | outcomes",0,1 | 1 | 1,624 | 716 | 895,(x1: 223.61 y1: 226.54) (x2: 450.20 y2: 231.00) | (x1: 193.49 y1: 236.54) (x2: 355.89 y2: 241.00) | (x1: 387.86 y1: 246.54) (x2: 417.43 y2: 251.00),Hypothesis 2: Mastery goals (H2a) | explain independent variance in beneficial experiential | outcomes,Hypothesis 2: Mastery goals (H2a) | explain independent variance in beneficial experiential | outcomes,0,4 | 4 | 4,1978 | 2041 | 2125,(x1: 64.00 y1: 510.87) (x2: 194.60 y2: 516.00) | (x1: 88.26 y1: 521.97) (x2: 288.06 y2: 526.99) | (x1: 164.95 y1: 532.97) (x2: 199.45 y2: 537.99),"in the “goal-and-reason” model, mastery goals and autonomous and controlled reasons were included as predictors (Model 3 in Table 3). | In line with Hypothesis 2a, mas- tery goals remained a positive predictor of interest, B  0.26 [0.16, 0.36], p  .001","...in the “goal-and-reason” model, mastery goals and autonomous and controlled reasons were included as predictors (Model 3 in Table 3)...In line with Hypothesis 2a, mastery goals remained a positive predictor of interest, B = 0.26 [0.16, 0.36], p .001...[Table 3, Job interest, Model 3, Study 1, Mastery goals (MAp), B = .26, partial eta squared = .06, p <.001]",0,5 | 6,5743 | 1473,(x1: 455.50 y1: 561.48) (x2: 473.10 y2: 588.50) | (x1: 426.09 y1: 505.98) (x2: 362.37 y2: 533.00),Model 3 in Table 3,"Table 3, Job interest, Model 3, Study 1, Mastery goals (MAp), B = .26, partial eta squared = .06, p <.001",5,5856,(x1: 393.93 y1: 583.48) (x2: 467.85 y2: 588.50),Nicolas Sommet,nicolas.sommet@unil.ch,1,7nbdl

We use borrowers' geographic locations to instrument for borrower-lender matching to distinguish the effect of securitization on the banks' ex post monitoring from its effect on ex ante screening. We further investigate direct evidence of banks' monitoring role by examining their actions following covenant violations and find that securitization-active lenders are more likely to grant waivers without changing loan terms.

Results from two preregistered experiments indicate that conspiracy beliefs were higher when people were exposed to seemingly redacted documents compared towhen theywere exposed to unredacted documents thatwere otherwise identical. In addition, unredacted documents consistently lowered conspiracy beliefs relative to controls while redacted documents had reduced or null effects, suggesting that lay epistemic interpretations of the redactions undermined the effect of information in the documents.

The results of a class-based exercise are presented to examine the role of model attributes on model creation, alteration, and student perception. Two popular CAD programs are used for the exercise: SolidWorks and ProjEngineer. General results from both programs are reported. Fewer more complex features are found to be correlated with reduced modeling time. Simple features are shown to be positively correlated with the number of features retained without change. More complex features are found to be negatively correlated with the number of new features. Student perceptions of model quality and intuitiveness are positively correlated with the amount of feature reuse. Student survey data shows a preference for simpler features, the naming of features, and the use of reference geometry.

It combines individual micro-data from two national surveys with a coarse geography, with geographically finer scaled data from the 2001 UK Census, using a reweighting deterministic algorithm. This creates a synthetic population of individuals/households in Leeds with attributes from both the survey and census datasets. Logistic regression analyses identify suitable constraint variables to use. The model is validated using linear regression and equal variance t-tests. Height, weight, age, gender, and residential postcode data were collected on children aged 3–13 years in the Leeds metropolitan area, and obesity described as above the 98th centile for the British reference dataset. Geographically weighted regression is used to investigate the relationship between different obesogenic environments and childhood obesity. Validation shows that the small-area estimates were robust. The different obesogenic environments, as well as the parameter estimates from the corresponding local regression analyses, are mapped, all of which demonstrate non-stationary relationships. These results show that social capital and poverty are strongly associated with childhood obesity. This paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate health variables at the small-area level. The key to this technique is the choice of the model’s input variables, which must be predictors for the output variables; this factor has not been stressed in other spatial microsimulation work. It also provides further evidence for the existence of obesogenic environments for children.",,,,,,,,,,69,7,,,,,1127-1134,,,,Edwards_SocSciMed_2009_1xv7x.pdf,results show that social capital | are strongly associated with childhood obesity,results show that social capital | are strongly associated with childhood obesity,0,1 | 1,3324 | 3369,(x1: 415.56 y1: 434.86) (x2: 519.73 y2: 439.12) | (x1: 206.93 y1: 444.44) (x2: 371.96 y2: 448.70),"Areas with lower social capital had statistically significant higher levels of childhood obesity in the study area.

Can organizational processes account for the selection and the popularization of new composers in the repertoire? By integrating field theory and organizational theory, this analysis shows that orchestra and musical director consecration and local elite cohesiveness favored innovative programming.

However, these are verbal statements and people must rely on metacognitive processes to correctly interpret them. Recently, Dodson and Dobolyi (2015) argued that a person's interpretation of a witness's verbal confidence is influenced by the diagnosticity of the features used to justify his or her identification. We tested this hypothesis in 2 experiments. Experiment 1 found that, relative to a confidence-only control, participants reduced their ratings of confidence when statements were justified using a facial feature that was shared by lineup members, but not when the feature was unique to the member chosen from the lineup. In Experiment 2, we found that participants integrated across the dimensions of witness confidence and accuracy, even when asked to make separate ratings. Altogether, the results suggest that people readily incorporate contextual information into their interpretations of witnesses' verbal expressions of confidence and evaluations of accuracy.","[Cash, Daniella K.; Lane, Sean M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, 236 Audubon Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Lane, SM (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, 236 Audubon Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",slane@lsu.edu,,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0147-7307,1573-661X,2017,41,2,10.1037/lhb0000216,"Law; Psychology, Social",Government & Law; Psychology,WOS:000397410500006,180-190,Cash,Daniella K.,17-Apr,Cash_LawHuman_2017_j12nx.pdf,"Experiment 1 found that, relative to a confidence-only control, participants reduced their ratings of confidence when statements were justified using a facial feature that was shared by lineup members","Experiment 1 found that, relative to a confidence-only control, participants reduced their ratings of confidence when statements were justified using a facial feature that was shared by lineup members",0,1,639,(x1: 400.39 y1: 204.54) (x2: 403.61 y2: 229.00),"When the featural justification ap- peared less diagnostic (i.e., a nondistinctive lineup), we replicated the finding that participants reduced their evaluations of witness confidence relative to confidence-only statements","When the featural justification ap- peared less diagnostic (i.e., a nondistinctive lineup), we replicated the finding that participants reduced their evaluations of witness confidence relative to confidence-only statements",0,5,6332,(x1: 413.69 y1: 572.98) (x2: 497.35 y2: 611.00),"replicating previous research, participants who received the nondistinctive lineup with a confidence-only statement provided higher perceived confidence judgments | than participants who had seen the confidence statement paired with the featural justifi- cation | t(161)  6.83, p  .001, d  1.07 | 95% CI [.74, 1.39].","…replicating previous research, participants who received the nondistinctive lineup with a confidence-only statement provided higher perceived confidence judgments…than participants who had seen the confidence statement paired with the featural justification…t(161) = 6.83, p < .001, d = 1.07, 95% CI[.74, 1.39].…",0,4 | 4 | 4 | 4,3220 | 3401 | 3521 | 3553,(x1: 507.55 y1: 319.98) (x2: 385.34 y2: 358.00) | (x1: 468.33 y1: 352.98) (x2: 327.99 y2: 379.99) | (x1: 434.51 y1: 375.05) (x2: 321.75 y2: 390.99) | (x1: 326.51 y1: 385.97) (x2: 397.02 y2: 390.99),"t(161)  6.83, p  .001, d  1.07, | 95% CI [.74, 1.39].","t(161) = 6.83, p < .001, d = 1.07, 95% CI = .74, 1.39",4 | 4,3521,(x1: 434.51 y1: 375.05) (x2: 324.00 y2: 390.99) | (x1: 326.51 y1: 385.97) (x2: 397.02 y2: 390.99),Sean M.

Although there is consistent evidence that personal experiences with legal actors contribute to attitudes toward the justice system, adolescents' attitudes may also be influenced vicariously through their friends' experiences with the justice system. Using data from a sample of 1,216 first-time male adolescent offenders, the present study examines how attitudes toward the justice system develop over 24 months following the adolescent's first arrest. Even after accounting for personal justice system experiences, including self-reported offending, time on the streets, and contacts with the police, results indicate that adolescents with friends who were arrested report more negative attitudes toward the justice system than those without friends who were arrested. Further, experiencing a friend's arrest has a larger impact on the attitudes of youths who are experiencing it for the first time. We provide evidence that attitudes toward the justice system are a product of accumulated social experiences-both personal and vicarious-with the justice system.","[Fine, Adam; Cavanagh, Caitlin; Donley, Sachiko; Cauffman, Elizabeth] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Psychol & Social Behav, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Steinberg, Laurence] Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Steinberg, Laurence] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Psychol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Frick, Paul J.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Frick, Paul J.] Australian Catholic Univ, Learning Sci Inst Australia, Sydney, NSW 2059, Australia","Fine, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, 4308 Social & Behav Sci Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",finea@uci.edu,"U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention [2010-JF-FX-0612]; John D. and Catherine T.

This is because higher income tends to induce breakthroughs to more democratic politics only after an incumbent dictator leaves office. And in the short run, faster economic growth increases the ruler's survival odds. Leader turnover appears to matter because of selection: In authoritarian states, reformist leaders tend to either democratize or lose power relatively quickly, so long-serving leaders are rarely reformers.

Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an essential tension between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu's field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.","[Foster, Jacob G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rzhetsky, Andrey] Univ Chicago, Conte Ctr Computat Neuropsychiat Genom, Med & Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Evans, James A.] Univ Chicago, Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Evans, James A.] Univ Chicago, Knowledge Lab, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Foster, JG (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, 264 Haines Hall,375 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",foster@soc.ucla.edu,"NSF by the John Templeton Foundation [SBE 0915730, 39147]",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2015,80,5,10.1177/0003122415601618,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000362448400001,875-908,Foster,Jacob G.,15-Oct,Foster_AmSocioRev_2015_zw1xn.pdf,we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation.,we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation.,0,1,2571,(x1: 279.78 y1: 359.70) (x2: 434.51 y2: 376.01),"subversive innovation, if published, should display a higher | variance in acclaim","subversive innovation, if published, should display a higher | variance in acclaim",0,6 | 6,3338 | 3411,(x1: 391.73 y1: 368.40) (x2: 277.55 y2: 397.94) | (x1: 340.90 y1: 392.40) (x2: 425.53 y2: 397.94),"We also confirm our conjecture that sur- prisal is positively correlated with the uncer- tainty of reward, which we operationalized as the standard deviation in citations. | with the rare, risky strategies again having larger regression coefficients (see Table 2).","We also confirm our conjecture that surprisal is positively correlated with the uncertainty of reward, which we operationalized as the standard deviation in citations...with the rare, risky strategies again having larger regression coefficients (see Table 2).

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) share abnormalities in hot executive functions such as reward-based decision-making, as measured in the temporal discounting task (TD). No studies, however, have directly compared these disorders to investigate common/distinct neural profiles underlying such abnormalities. We wanted to test whether reward-based decision-making is a shared transdiagnostic feature of both disorders with similar neurofunctional substrates or whether it is a shared phenotype with disorder-differential neurofunctional underpinnings. Methods. Age and IQ-matched boys with ASD (N= 20), with OCD (N= 20) and 20 healthy controls, performed an individually-adjusted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) TD task. Brain activation and performance were compared between groups. Results. Boys with ASD showed greater choice-impulsivity than OCD and control boys. Whole-brain between-group comparison revealed shared reductions in ASD and OCD relative to control boys for delayed-immediate choices in right ventromedial/lateral orbitofrontal cortex extending intomedial/inferior prefrontal cortex, and in cerebellum, posterior cingulate and precuneus. For immediate-delayed choices, patients relative to controls showed reduced activation in anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex reaching into left caudate, which, at a trend level, was more decreased in ASD than OCD patients, and in bilateral temporal and inferior parietal regions. Conclusions. This first fMRI comparison between youth with ASD and with OCD, using a reward-based decision-making task, shows predominantly shared neurofunctional abnormalities during TD in key ventromedial, orbital-and inferior fronto-striatal, temporo-parietal and cerebellar regions of temporal foresight and reward processing, suggesting trans-diagnostic neurofunctional deficits.","[Carlisi, C.

White matter (WM) abnormalities are proposed as potential endophenotypic markers of bipolar disorder (BD). In a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) voxel-based analysis (VBA) study of families multiply affected with BD, we previously reported that widespread abnormalities of fractional anisotropy (FA) are associated with both BD and genetic liability for illness. In the present study, we further investigated the endophenotypic potential of WM abnormalities by applying DTI tractography to specifically investigate tracts implicated in the pathophysiology of BD. Method. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired from 19 patients with BD type I from multiply affected families, 21 of their unaffected first-degree relatives and 18 healthy volunteers. DTI tractography was used to identify the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus (UF), arcuate portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), corpus callosum, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC). Regression analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of participant group and genetic liability on FA and radial diffusivity (RD) in each tract. Results. We detected a significant effect of group on both FA and RD in the cingulum, SLF, callosal splenium and ILF driven by reduced FA and increased RD in patients compared to controls and relatives. Increasing genetic liability was associated with decreased FA and increased RD in the UF, and decreased FA in the SLF, among patients. Conclusions. WM microstructural abnormalities in limbic, temporal and callosal pathways represent microstructural abnormalities associated with BD whereas alterations in the SLF and UF may represent potential markers of endophenotypic risk.","[Emsell, L.; Sunaert, S.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Imaging & Pathol, Translat MRI, Leuven, Belgium; [Emsell, L.; Sunaert, S.] Katholieke Univ Leuven Hosp, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Emsell, L.; Forde, N.; Cannon, D.; McDonald, C.] Natl Univ Ireland, Inst Clin Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Chaddock, C.; Walshe, M.; Bramon, E.; Murray, R.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol Med, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Van Hecke, W.] IcoMetrix NV, Leuven, Belgium; [Barker, G.

This 2-arm group randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of PHAT Life, a sexual risk reduction program, compared with a time-matched health promotion program for youth on probation. Method: Male and female 13- to 17-year-olds (M = 16.08; SD = 1.09) recently arrested and placed on probation at an Evening Reporting Center were eligible for the study. Youth were 66% male, and 90% African American. Teens self-reported their sexual behavior (condom use, number of sexual partners) at baseline and 6 months. Retention was 85%. Results: Youth were randomized to PHAT Life (n = 163) or a health promotion program (n = 147). Among youth reporting the highest risk at baseline (a composite measure of multiple partners and inconsistent condom use), those who received PHAT Life were over 4 times more likely than the control group to report a lower level of risk (i.e., no sex or one partner plus consistent condom use) by 6 months, OR = 4.28 with 95% CI [1.37, 13.38], SE = 0.58, p = .01. Among sexually active teens who reported sexual debut before 12-years-old, those who received PHAT Life reported significantly fewer sexual partners at 6-months than controls, partial eta squared = .32, p = .002. Conclusions: Findings support PHAT Life's efficacy to reduce sexual risk for juvenile offenders on probation. Future research should examine how best to disseminate PHAT Life to ensure that it is self-sustaining within the juvenile justice system.","[Donenberg, Geri] Univ Illinois, Dept Med, Coll Med, 1603 W Taylor St,845 SPHPI, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Donenberg, Geri; Emerson, Erin; Kendall, Ashley D.] Univ Illinois, Ctr Disseminat & Implementat Sci, Hlth Youths Program, Community Outreach Intervent Projects, 1603 W Taylor St,845 SPHPI, Chicago, IL 60612 USA","Donenberg, G (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Med, Coll Med, 1603 W Taylor St,845 SPHPI, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.; Donenberg, G (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Disseminat & Implementat Sci, Hlth Youths Program, Community Outreach Intervent Projects, 1603 W Taylor St,845 SPHPI, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",gerid@uic.edu,National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities [R01MD005861],AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,2018,37,4,10.1037/hea0000582,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,WOS:000428869600008,364-374,Donenberg,Geri,18-Apr,Donenberg_HealthPsych_2018_yml6y.pdf,"Among sexually active teens who reported sexual debut before 12-years-old, those who received PHAT Life reported significantly fewer sexual partners at 6-months than controls","Among sexually active teens who reported sexual debut before 12-years-old, those who received PHAT Life reported significantly fewer sexual partners at 6-months than controls",0,1,1297,(x1: 412.12 y1: 282.54) (x2: 334.20 y2: 307.00),we expected that PHAT Life participants would report | a significantly greater reduction in number of sexual partners from baseline to 6-months than teens in the control group,we expected that PHAT Life participants would report | a significantly greater reduction in number of sexual partners from baseline to 6-months than teens in the control group,0,2 | 2,6639 | 6752,(x1: 351.60 y1: 647.65) (x2: 328.38 y2: 664.05) | (x1: 334.38 y1: 670.42) (x2: 327.71 y2: 698.22),"Among sexually active youth who reported early sexual debut, the interaction of time with arm was highly significant in predict- ing change in number of sexual partners, F(1, 24)  11.52, partial eta squared  .32 with 95% CI [.05, .54], p  .002","Among sexually active youth who reported early sexual debut, the interaction of time with arm was highly significant in predicting change in number of sexual partners, F(1, 24) = 11.52, partial eta squared = .32 with 95% CI [.05, .54], p = .002.",0,7,1516,(x1: 57.00 y1: 649.98) (x2: 233.12 y2: 688.00),"F(1, 24)  11.52, partial eta squared  .32 with 95% CI [.05, .54], p  .002","F(1, 24) = 11.52, partial eta squared = .32 with 95% CI [.05, .54], p = .002",7,1686,(x1: 198.14 y1: 672.05) (x2: 233.12 y2: 688.00),Geri Donenberg,gerid@uic.edu,1,0pyzn

This article argues that prevalence of malaria can similarly serve to asymmetrically enhance rebels' defensive capabilities and thus prolong civil war. Malaria prevalence does so in three complementary ways. First, while malaria can inflict costs on both government and rebel troops, these costs are magnified for larger and denser human groups; thereby ensuring that the costs of malaria will often be higher among government troop deployments. Second, because government soldiers are rotated in and out of conflict zones whereas insurgents typically are not, the former are likely to have a higher nonimmune exposure rate than the latter, which further ensures that government forces will be more susceptible to contracting and spreading malaria. Third, malaria can also indirectly prolong civil war by helping to maintain a socio-geographic environment that is conducive to insurgency. These three complementary factors advantage rebel forces' abilities to resist defeat by government forces and prolong civil conflicts. I empirically test these arguments by examining the duration of civil wars and find strong support for a prolonging effect of malaria on civil conflict.","[Bagozzi, Benjamin E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, 1414 Social Sci,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Bagozzi, BE (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, 1414 Social Sci,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bbagozzi@umn.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-0027,1552-8766,2016,60,5,10.1177/0022002714550202,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000380958600002,813-839,Bagozzi,Benjamin E.,16-Aug,Bagozzi_JournConflictRes_2016_7dz39.pdf,This article argues that prevalence of malaria can similarly serve to asymmetrically enhance rebels’ defensive capabilities and thus prolong civil war.,This article argues that prevalence of malaria can similarly serve to asymmetrically enhance rebels’ defensive capabilities and thus prolong civil war.,0,1,248,(x1: 48.64 y1: 258.13) (x2: 327.29 y2: 275.02),Hypothesis 2: The pre-conflict level of malaria prevalence within a given region will only increase a civil war’s duration for civil wars involving rela- tively weak rebel groups.,Hypothesis 2: The pre-conflict level of malaria prevalence within a given region will only increase a civil war’s duration for civil wars involving rela- tively weak rebel groups.,0,11,1132,(x1: 58.56 y1: 255.49) (x2: 161.05 y2: 283.91),"I present the main results for civil war duration sequentially in Table 1 | The estimates presented in Model 3 confirm my expectations.

Middle school students (N = 736) learned about probability calculus and were assigned to one of four instructional conditions. Individual interest and perceived competence in mathematics was examined as moderator on three measures of situational interest: triggered situational interest, maintained situational interest, and perceived value. Context personalization promoted triggered and maintained situational interest, and perception of value among students with low individual interest and perceived competence in mathematics. Similar results were observed for example choice, with the exception of perceived value. Although context personalization and example choice promoted effort for students with low individual interest, we observed no effect on performance. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Students were most likely to favor taking action on their own over all of the other response strategies. Students with positive perceptions of their schools were more likely to say they would do something rather than ignore their peer's dangerous intentions.

The KF embedded assessment tools, the Analytical Toolkit and Applet, showed increased KF participation and connectedness during the year. Regression analysis showed that KF participation predicted conceptual understanding for both classes. Analyses of e-portfolios revealed that the students adopted nine reflective strategies in knowledge building, and that reflective metadiscourse strategies involving metacognitive and collective processes were related with deeper conceptual understanding. Analyses of online discourse threads further showed that metadiscourse involving collective processes was associated with higher levels of knowledge advances. Both classes showed improvement and the KBP class outperformed the KBR class on KF participation, metadiscourse processes and conceptual understanding. This study has theoretical implications advancing the idea of metadiscourse, discourse about discourse, for enriching research on knowledge building and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL).

This study population comprised men who were divorced in 1985 (n   72,246). The risk of pharmaceutically treated depression from 2005 to 2009 was compared for those who remarried or remained divorced between 1986 and 2004.

The results showed that, even though divorced men who remarried had markers of lower depression risk in earlier life such as higher cognitive and physical function, higher stress resilience and socioeconomic advantages than men who remained divorced, remarriage was associated with a statistically significant elevated risk of depression with an adjusted hazard ratio (and 95% confidence interval) of 1.27(1.03 1.55), compared with men who remained divorced.

Using this framework, values (egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric) and time orientation (concern with immediate, and concern with future consequences) are hypothesized to relate to preference for biofuels. To test these hypotheses, a panel of U.S. consumers completed a brief inventory of values, the consideration of future consequences-14 scale, and made a series of choices in fueling scenarios. Results revealed that values and CFC overlap, and that preference for biofuels was inversely related to egoistic values and consideration of immediate consequences and positively related to biospheric values and consideration of future consequences, supporting the three-dimensional social dilemma framework.

The most prominent of these is Cosmides' investigations of cheater detection on social contract versions of the Wason selection task [Cognition 31 (1989) 187-276]. Subsequent to Cosmides' initial investigations, several researchers [Evol Hum Behar 21 (200) 25-37; Manage Decis Econ 19 (1998) 467-480; J Genet Psychol 163 (2002) 425-444; Evol Hum Behar 27 (2006) 366-380] have argued that people also are competent at detecting altruism on the Wason selection task, suggesting that there is nothing privileged about the detection of cheaters. However, an analysis of the selection tasks on which these claims are based suggests that participants may have solved these altruism-detection tasks correctly because the scenarios explicitly or implicitly provide the answer to the task in the scenario [Evol Hum Behar 21 (200) 25-37; Manage Decis Econ 19 (1998) 467-480; J Genet Psycho! 163 (2002) 425 444], or due to confounds in the cheater-detection tasks leading to the (misleading) appearance of enhanced altruist-detection performance [Evol Hum Behar 27 (2006) 366-380]. We tested our conjecture by giving participants selection tasks with and without the answer embedded in the scenario. Performance dropped significantly on the altruism-detection tasks when the embedded answers were removed, whereas performance on cheater-detection versions was unaffected by the manipulation. A reanalysis of the findings of Oda et al suggested that participants performed significantly worse on their altruism-detection problems than their cheater-detection problems a finding that we replicate after removing confounds from the cheater-detection tasks of Oda et al. The results reaffirm the specificity of cheater-detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this paper was twofold. First, we explored changes in social network and relationship characteristics across the transition out of secondary school. Second, we examined within-person and between-person effects of personality on these social network changes. Results based on a series of multilevel models to a longitudinal sample of 2287 young adults revealed four main findings. First, social networks increased in size, and this increase was mainly due to a larger number of nonkin. Stable social networks during the transition consisted mainly of family ties but were generally characterized by high closeness. Second, extraversion and openness consistently predicted network size, whereas agreeableness predicted network overlap. Third, increases in emotional closeness were found only for kin; closeness was generally lower for unstable relationships. Fourth, changes in emotional closeness were related to personality, particularly neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness for stable relationships; for unstable relationships, however, closeness was related to extraversion and openness. The article concludes by discussing the role of personality for social relationship development and the active moulding of social networks in young adulthood.

The postpartum period is well-known risk period for the first onset of autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITDs) as well as first onset of psychiatric disorders. These two disorders are some of the most prevalent medical conditions postpartum, often misdiagnosed and disabling if left untreated. Our study was designed to explore the possible bidirectional association between AITDs and psychiatric disorders during the postpartum period. Methods. A population-based cohort study through linkage of Danish national registers, which comprised 312 779 women who gave birth to their first child during 1997-2010. We conducted Poisson regression analysis to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of psychiatric disorders among women with first-onset AITDs, the IRR of AITDs among women with first-onset psychiatric disorders as well as the overlap between these disorders using a comorbidity index. Results. Women with first-onset AITDs postpartum were more likely to have first-onset psychiatric disorders than women who did not have postpartum AITDs (IRR = 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-2.81). Women with first-onset postpartum psychiatric disorders had a higher risk of AITDs than women with no psychiatric disorders (IRR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.45-3.20). The comorbidity index 2 years after delivery was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.61-2.90), indicating a comorbidity between first-onset AITDs and psychiatric disorders. Conclusions. First-onset AITDs and psychiatric disorders co-occur in the postpartum period, which has relevance to further studies on the etiologies of these disorders and why childbirth in particular triggers the onset.","[Bergink, V.] Erasmus MC, Dept Psychiat, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Pop, V.

Herpes virus infections can cause cognitive impairment during and after acute encephalitis. Although chronic, latent/persistent infection is considered to be relatively benign, some studies have documented cognitive impairment in exposed persons that is untraceable to encephalitis. These studies were conducted among schizophrenia (SZ) patients or older community dwellers, among whom it is difficult to control for the effects of co-morbid illness and medications. To determine whether the associations can be generalized to other groups, we examined a large sample of younger control individuals, SZ patients and their non-psychotic relatives (n = 1852). Method. Using multivariate models, cognitive performance was evaluated in relation to exposures to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), controlling for familial and diagnostic status and sociodemographic variables, including occupation and educational status. Composite cognitive measures were derived from nine cognitive domains using principal components of heritability (PCH). Exposure was indexed by antibodies to viral antigens. Results. PCH1, the most heritable component of cognitive performance, declines with exposure to CMV or HSV-1 regardless of case/relative/control group status (p = 1.09 x 10(-5) and 0.01 respectively), with stronger association with exposure to multiple herpes viruses (beta = -0.25, p = 7.28 x 10(-10)). There were no significant interactions between exposure and group status. Conclusions. Latent/persistent herpes virus infections can be associated with cognitive impairments regardless of other health status.","[Watson, A. M. M.; Prasad, K. M.; Klei, L.; Wood, J. A.; Nimgaonkar, V.

The research team collected and analyzed longitudinal data (surveys, interviews, observations) in high schools located in conservative, liberal, and centrist communities within one swing state. Findings indicate that students' political interest increased during the election. These increases were related to greater public attention to politics and having opportunities to explore multiple sides of political issues and express political opinions.

Drawing on the ""romance of leadership"" perspective, the authors argue that performance information shapes employee attributions of leader quality and perceptions of a need for change in ways that affect their acceptance of management authority, conceptualized using Simon's notion of a ""zone of acceptance."" A survey experiment was conducted among 1,740 teachers, randomly assigning true performance information about each respondent's own school. When employees were exposed to signals showing low or high performance, their acceptance of management authority increased, whereas average performance signals reduced employee acceptance of management authority. The findings suggest that performance measurement can alter public sector authority relations and have implications regarding how public managers can use performance information strategically to gain acceptance of management authority and organizational change.","[Nielsen, Poul Aaes] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Odense, Denmark; [Jacobsen, Christian Botcher] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark","Nielsen, PA (reprint author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Odense, Denmark.",aaes@sam.sdu.dk; christianj@ps.au.dk,Danish Council for Independent Research [1327-00015B],WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-3352,1540-6210,2018,78,5,10.1111/puar.12947,Public Administration,Public Administration,WOS:000443006100003,684-693,Nielsen,Poul Aaes,SEP-OCT 2018,Nielsen_PubAdminRev_2018_dxmxy.pdf,"When employees were exposed to signals showing low | performance, their acceptance of management authority increased,","When employees were exposed to signals showing low | performance, their acceptance of management authority increased,",0,1 | 1,1739 | 1798,(x1: 227.61 y1: 296.06) (x2: 418.58 y2: 302.34) | (x1: 449.65 y1: 296.06) (x2: 260.30 y2: 314.34),Hypothesis 2: Performance information showing low performance increases employee acceptance of management authority.,Hypothesis 2: Performance information showing low performance increases employee acceptance of management authority.,0,4,5778,(x1: 319.46 y1: 512.74) (x2: 356.69 y2: 542.75),"The main findings for the three subexperiments (for low, average, and high performance signals) are shown in table 3. | We also find that teachers become more willing to accept management decisions when they are given information that school performance is relatively low.","The main findings for the three subexperiments (for low, average, and high performance signals) are shown in table 3...We also find that teachers become more willing to accept management decisions when they are given information that school performance is relatively low.

Does social trust at school affect students’ smoking and drinking behavior in Japan?,Takakura,Minoru,2011,10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.003,0277-9536,Social Science & Medicine,SocSciMed,Social Science & Medicine,FALSE,,,,,"This study examined the individual and contextual effects of cognitive social capital at school on cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking in Japanese high school students. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 3248 students in grades 10–12 (aged 15–18 years) at 29 public high schools across Okinawa, Japan in 2008. The individual-level cognitive social capital studied was generalized trust. Using multi-level logistic regression models, the effects of individual- and contextual-level cognitive social capital on smoking and drinking were analyzed. Contextual-level cognitive social capital was measured on the basis of aggregated individual responses to the trust question at school level. After adjustment for the covariates, individual-level trust was negatively associated with smoking and drinking among boys and girls. Similarly, after adjustment for the covariates, school-level trust showed an inverse association with smoking for girls. A similar but not statistically significant association was observed for boys. On the other hand, school-level trust was not associated with drinking among boys or girls. After adjustment for individual-level trust and the covariates, these findings were in the same direction, but the school-level trust for girls no longer had a significant contextual effect on smoking. The findings suggest evidence of the individual effect of cognitive social capital on adolescents’ smoking and drinking, and that the contextual effect of social capital on smoking was inconclusive.

The evidence is inconclusive, however, as to whether happiness can be communicated through the sense of smell via chemosignals. As chemosignals are a known medium for transferring negative emotions from a sender to a receiver, we examined whether chemosignals are also involved in the transmission of positive emotions. Positive emotions are important for overall well-being and yet relatively neglected in research on chemosignaling, arguably because of the stronger survival benefits linked with negative emotions. We observed that exposure to body odor collected from senders of chemosignals in a happy state induced a facial expression and perceptual-processing style indicative of happiness in the receivers of those signals.

Interindividual variability in the acuity of the ANS correlates with mathematical achievement, but the causes of this correlation have never been established. We acquired psychophysical measures of ANS acuity in child and adult members of an indigene group in the Amazon, the Mundurucu, who have a very restricted numerical lexicon and highly variable access to mathematics education. By comparing Mundurucu subjects with and without access to schooling, we found that education significantly enhances the acuity with which sets of concrete objects are estimated. These results indicate that culture and education have an important effect on basic number perception. We hypothesize that symbolic and nonsymbolic numerical thinking mutually enhance one another over the course of mathematics instruction.","[Piazza, Manuela; Dehaene, Stanislas] INSERM, Cognit Neuroimaging Unit, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Piazza, Manuela; Dehaene, Stanislas] CEA, I2BM, DSV, NeuroSpin Ctr, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Piazza, Manuela; Dehaene, Stanislas] Univ Paris 11, Orsay, France; [Piazza, Manuela] Univ Trento, Ctr Mind Brain Sci, Trenton, NJ USA; [Pica, Pierre] CNRS, UMR 7023, St Denis, France; [Pica, Pierre] Univ Paris 08, St Denis, France; [Izard, Veronique] Univ Paris 05, Lab Psychol & Percept, Paris, France; [Izard, Veronique] CNRS, UMR 8158, Paris, France; [Spelke, Elizabeth S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Piazza, M (reprint author), Ctr Mind Brain Sci, Funct NeuroImaging Lab, 31 Corso Bettini Rovereto, I-38068 Trento, Italy.",manuela.piazza@unitn.it,NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD023103],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,2013,24,6,10.1177/0956797612464057,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,WOS:000320026000026,1037-1043,Piazza,Manuela,13-Jun,Piazza_PsychologSci_2013_q7pd5.pdf,"By comparing Mundurucú subjects with and without access to schooling, we found that education significantly enhances the acuity with which sets of concrete objects are estimated.","By comparing Mundurucú subjects with and without access to schooling, we found that education significantly enhances the acuity with which sets of concrete objects are estimated.",0,1,3512,(x1: 440.44 y1: 351.65) (x2: 213.75 y2: 381.15),The results indicate that edu- cation is associated with a significant increase in the acuity of the ANS,The results indicate that edu- cation is associated with a significant increase in the acuity of the ANS,0,5,1009,(x1: 429.72 y1: 421.52) (x2: 387.47 y2: 451.02),"The average w for uneducated adult subjects was 0.31, | The value of w dropped to 0.19 in adult Mundurucús who went to school for at least 1 year.

This ability has been regarded as the basis of conscious self-perception. However, it is not yet known whether infants are also sensitive to aspects of the self when they cannot control the sensory feedback by means of self-performed actions. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of visual-tactile contingency to self-perception in infants. In Experiment 1, 7- and 10-month-olds were presented with two video displays of lifelike baby doll legs. The infant's left leg was stroked contingently with only one of the video displays. The results showed that 7- and 10-month-olds looked significantly longer at the contingent display than at the non-contingent display. Experiment 2 was conducted to investigate the role of morphological characteristics in contingency detection. Ten-month-olds were presented with video displays of two neutral objects (i.e., oblong wooden blocks of approximately the same size as the doll legs) being stroked in the same way as in Experiment 1. No preference was found for either the contingent or the non-contingent display but our results confirm a significant decrease in looking time to the contingent display compared to Experiment 1. These results indicate that detection of visual-tactile contingency as one important aspect of self-perception is present very early in ontogeny. Furthermore, this ability appears to be limited to the perception of objects that strongly resemble the infant's body, suggesting an early sensitivity to the morphology of one's own body.

Ninety six participants were instructed to be extraverted or introverted in a 10-minute dyadic discussion. State extraversion had a strong effect on positive affect and smaller (but still strong) effects on pleasant and activated affect, with these latter two effects almost equal in magnitude. This pattern of findings appears to increase confidence that the effect of state extraversion is genuine rather than the result of construct overlap, in that extraversion's effect on positive affect is not dominated by its effect on activated effect. No support for reward sensitivity, as a potential explanatory mechanism was found. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[McNiel, J.

Two trait-based dimensions of coping relevant to boredom were considered, namely approach - versus avoidance-oriented and cognitively - versus behaviorally-oriented coping strategies. The two dimensions were assessed in a self-report questionnaire administered to 537 grade 11 students (55.3% female, M-age = 17.15 years). Additionally, 79 of these participants completed state-based boredom-related coping measures over a 2-week period using an experience sampling method. Analyses of the trait measures suggested that two contrasting, broad approaches characterized participants' strategies for coping with boredom, namely a cognitive-approach orientation and a behavioral-avoidance orientation. In both the trait- and state-based analyses, the cognitive-approach orientation was associated with lower levels of boredom. Implications for interventions promoting the use of cognitive-approach strategies for dealing with boredom in the classroom are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Flipped instruction caused a shift in student workload without appreciably changing the overall study time. The treatment impact on student performance gradually diminished over time, showing a small but statistically significant effect with the final exam. No marked interaction was identified, indicating that flipped instruction benefited students of diverse backgrounds uniformly. Students in the flipped section showed mixed feelings with about one fifth of them displaying polarized attitudes. Open-ended student survey responses revealed non-compliance with pre-class studying as a serious implementation issue: By slowing down the overall pace of the class, it negatively affected students with different study behaviors and characteristics in ways that partly explained the small, diminishing treatment effect and absence of marked interaction.

Yet fundamental questions remain regarding the nature and empirical study of attentional bias (AB). We thus aimed to (a) test a novel conceptualization and related operationalization of AB expression in time and (b) illuminate the nature of AB and specifically its temporal expression. We examined AB expression in time by means of a novel trial-level bias score (TL-BS) analysis of dot probe task data in two experiments-among spider phobics and healthy controls, and among smoking-deprived daily smokers. Findings revealed evidence of the dynamic expression of AB in time; furthermore, TL-BS parameters demonstrated unique associations with psychopathology and addiction beyond traditional bias score. The present research may help to bring the conceptualization and quantification of AB closer to the nature of the phenomenon and thereby advance basic and clinical knowledge.","[Zvielli, Ariel; Bernstein, Amit] Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel; [Koster, Ernst H.

Distinguishing hypothetical willingness from behavioral intentions to initiate HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): Findings from a large cohort of gay and bisexual men in the U.S.,Rendina,H.

Objective: We sought to examine differences between hypothetical willingness and behavioral intentions to begin PrEP in a national sample of gay and bisexual men (GBM) across the U.S. Methods: We utilized data collected in 2015 to examine differences between those Unwilling (42.6% n ¼ 375), Willing but not intending (41.4%, n ¼ 365), and willing and Intending to take PrEP (15.9%, n ¼ 140) in a multivariable, multinomial logistic regression. Results: Men with less education had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP. Compared to men unsure about PrEP's efficacy, those who believed PrEP was at least 90% efficacious had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP. Those who saw themselves as appropriate candidates for PrEP had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP while those who saw themselves as inappropriate candidates for PrEP had lower odds of Intending to take PrEP in comparison to men unsure if they were appropriate candidates. Increased motivation for condom non-use because of perceived sexual pressure by partners was associated with higher odds of Intending to take PrEP. The groups did not differ by risk behavior nor recent STI diagnosis. Conclusions: Overall, the distinction between willingness and intentions to take PrEP was meaningful and may help explain disparities between PrEP acceptability and uptake. While much of the literature has focused on hypothetical willingness to take PrEP, these results highlight the importance of simultaneously assessing willingness and intentions when examining correspondence with uptake and developing interventions to increase PrEP uptake.",,,,,,,,,,172,,,,,,115-123,,,,Rendina_SocSciMed_2017_vy818.pdf,Men with less education had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP,Men with less education had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP,0,1,2230,(x1: 235.84 y1: 423.62) (x2: 469.66 y2: 428.03),men with lower | education | were also those most likely to intend to take PrEP,men with lower | education | were also those most likely to intend to take PrEP,0,7 | 7 | 7,2914 | 2940 | 3029,(x1: 181.64 y1: 552.28) (x2: 244.48 y2: 557.18) | (x1: 42.52 y1: 562.71) (x2: 79.86 y2: 567.61) | (x1: 157.38 y1: 573.20) (x2: 87.24 y2: 588.53),"Finally, we compared the men in the Intending group to those in the Unwilling | groups using multinomial logistic regression models | (see Table 4) | Compared with men with a college degree or more, those with a high school degree or less had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP.","Finally, we compared the men in the Intending group to those in the Unwilling...groups using multinomial logistic regression models...(see Table 4)...Compared with men with a college degree or more, those with a high school degree or less had higher odds of Intending to take PrEP.

To assess importance of guiding instructions, participants in Experiment 2 were shown a video of the building. Again orientation errors were less in previously visited rooms.

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These ""cognitive-emotional currents"" create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application.

Previous research, however, usually measures neighborhood context only once and does not account for length of residence, thereby understating the detrimental effects of long-term neighborhood disadvantage. This study investigates effects of duration of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods on high school graduation. It follows 4,154 children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, measuring neighborhood context once per year from age 1 to 17. The analysis overcomes the problem of dynamic neighborhood selection by adapting novel methods of causal inference for time-varying treatments. In contrast to previous analyses, these methods do not ""control away"" the effect of neighborhood context operating indirectly through time-varying characteristics of the family; thus, they capture the full impact of a lifetime of neighborhood disadvantage. We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods has a severe impact on high school graduation that is considerably larger than effects reported in prior research. We estimate that growing up in the most (compared to the least) disadvantaged quintile of neighborhoods reduces the probability of graduation from 96 to 76 percent for black children, and from 95 to 87 percent for nonblack children.","[Wodtke, Geoffrey T.; Harding, David J.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Populat Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Wodtke, Geoffrey T.; Harding, David J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Sociol, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Harding, David J.] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Harding, David J.] Univ Michigan, Survey Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Elwert, Felix] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI USA","Wodtke, GT (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Ctr Populat Studies, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA.",wodtke@umich.edu,"NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD007339, R24 HD041028]",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,2011,76,5,10.1177/0003122411420816,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000295334500004,713-736,Wodtke,Geoffrey T.,11-Oct,Wodtke_AmSocioRev_2011_b2nb9.pdf,We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods has a severe impact on high school graduation,We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods has a severe impact on high school graduation,0,1,2272,(x1: 51.85 y1: 408.75) (x2: 149.71 y2: 425.06),Our results indicate that sustained expo- sure to disadvantaged neighborhoods | throughout the entire childhood life course has a devastating impact on the chances of graduating from high school.,Our results indicate that sustained expo- sure to disadvantaged neighborhoods | throughout the entire childhood life course has a devastating impact on the chances of graduating from high school.,0,19 | 19,864 | 1071,(x1: 63.49 y1: 332.40) (x2: 203.65 y2: 349.94) | (x1: 51.49 y1: 392.40) (x2: 167.56 y2: 421.94),"Table 5 shows | stabilized IPT-weighted esti- mates for the effect of duration-weighted exposure to different neighborhood contexts on the probability of high school graduation. | The stabilized IPT- weighted estimates indicate that living in a more disadvantaged neighborhood throughout childhood has a substantial negative effect on the chances of high school graduation among blacks (θ

Yet this evidence comes primarily from cross-establishment surveys, which do not provide visibility into individual managers' choices. Using longitudinal personnel records from an information services firm in which managers had considerable discretion over employee salaries, we estimate multilevel models that indicate no support for the proposition that female managers reduce the gender wage gap among their subordinates.

In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant information.

It presents three theoretical arguments: (i) language proficiency positively affects national identification; (ii) contrastingly, national identification positively influences language proficiency; and (iii) there is a reciprocal relationship between both constructs. To test these potentially contradictory claims empirically, we use data on first-generation immigrants in Germany measured in four waves (1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003) from the German Socio-Economic Panel study.

We argue that the extent and nature of resource reconfiguration through divestiture may be affected by both high and low extremes of performance relative to a firm's historical aspirations. Based on analysis of divestiture counts, we find that firms with increasing performance, especially when they also have high levels of performance, appear to use divestitures in a ""complementary Penrose effect"" that frees resources firms can use for future growth, with the greatest impact on the number of partial rather than full divestitures. With more limited data on divestiture value, we find relationships of both increasing and decreasing performance with divestiture activity.

The objective of this study is to shed light on this debate by presenting new evidence on the red herring hypothesis. This study adopts quantile regression analysis to reexamine variations of the red herring effect on healthcare expenditures in Taiwan over the period 2005-2009. Findings show that population aging estimates decrease from positive to negative along quantiles for the whole sample and become insignificant across most quantiles for the subsample of people aged 65 and over. For whole sample and subsample of people aged 65 and over, proximity-to-death coefficients are significantly positive in most quantiles. Moreover, time-to-death estimates show a substantial upward trend towards date of death. In particular, quarters one and two prior to death produce a significant positive impact on healthcare expenditures at the highest healthcare expenditure quantiles. The new empirical evidence from this study provides a more complete picture of the red herring effect on healthcare expenditures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We test this prediction in four studies. First, using multi-rater evaluations of young managers, we find that self-reliance relates positively to leadership evaluations for women, but not for men. Next, in each of three experiments, we manipulate the gender of a leader and the agentic trait he or she displays (e.g., self-reliance, dominance, no discrete agentic trait). We find that self-reliant female leaders are evaluated as better leaders than self-reliant male leaders are. In contrast, we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively, but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait. Consistent with expectancy violation theory, the female advantage in the relationship between self-reliance and leadership evaluations emerges because self-reliant female leaders are seen as similarly competent, but more communal, than self-reliant male leaders are.

The present study examined the effects of the Class-Wide Function-related Intervention Teams (CW-FIT), a group contingency intervention, on the on-task and disruptive behavior of elementary school students with or at risk for emotional behavior disorders (EBD). Seventeen elementary schools, 159 general education teachers, and 313 students participated in the randomized-control group design study. Fidelity of implementation was strong for intervention group teachers and was measured across groups and throughout baseline conditions. Results suggest that CW-FIT can be used to increase on-task behavior and reduce the disruptive behavior of students with or at risk for EBD. In addition, teachers in intervention classes increased praise and reduced reprimands to individual students and along with their students, reported high levels of consumer satisfaction.","[Wills, Howard; Kamps, Debra; Fleming, Kandace] Univ Kansas, Kansas City, KS USA; [Hansen, Blake] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Wills, H (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Juniper Gardens Childrens Project, 444 Minnesota Ave 300, Kansas City, KS 66101 USA.",hpwills@ku.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0014-4029,2163-5560,2016,83,1,10.1177/0014402916658658,"Education, Special; Rehabilitation",Education & Educational Research; Rehabilitation,WOS:000385956900005,58-76,Wills,Howard,16-Oct,Wills_ExChildren_2016_9v530.pdf,Results suggest that CW-FIT can be used to increase on-task behavior | of students with or at risk for EBD,Results suggest that CW-FIT can be used to increase on-task behavior | of students with or at risk for EBD,0,1 | 1,2707 | 2811,(x1: 376.10 y1: 311.61) (x2: 279.71 y2: 329.42) | (x1: 429.84 y1: 323.61) (x2: 186.22 y2: 341.42),Our primary hypothesis was that the students receiving the CW-FIT intervention would have improved on-task behavior,Our primary hypothesis was that the students receiving the CW-FIT intervention would have improved on-task behavior,0,4,2770,(x1: 400.20 y1: 260.65) (x2: 334.37 y2: 302.19),"Time, gender, and group were the independent variables in all models.

While the former have received a great deal of scholarly attention, judicial methods remain relatively understudied. When and why do rulers repress their rivals in court? The author argues that autocrats use a judicial strategy of repression when confronting challengers from within the ruling elite. Unlike regime outsiders, who pose a common, external threat to mobilize against, insiders present a more divisive target. When autocrats confront the latter, a judicial strategy legitimizes punishment, deters future rivals, and generates shared beliefs regarding incumbent strength and challenger weakness. Using original data on political prisoners in postcolonial sub-Saharan Africa, the author finds that autocrats were significantly more likely to use a judicial strategy against insiders and an extrajudicial strategy against outsiders. A case study of Kenya traces the logic of the theory, showing how intraregime conflict made courts a valuable instrument of state repression. The findings demonstrate how courts can play a central role in autocratic survival.","[Shen-Bayh, Fiona] Univ Michigan, Weiser Ctr Emerging Democracies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Shen-Bayh, F (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Weiser Ctr Emerging Democracies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",fishenbayh@berkeley.edu,National Science Foundation [SES-1535721]; UC Berkeley Institute of International Studies,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0043-8871,1086-3338,2018,70,3,10.1017/s0043887118000047,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000437444900001,321,Shen-Bayh,Fiona,18-Jul,Shen-Bayh_WorldPolitics_2018_kxrx6.pdf,"Using original data on political prisoners in postcolonial sub-Saharan Africa, the author finds that autocrats were significantly more likely to use a judicial strategy against insiders","Using original data on political prisoners in postcolonial sub-Saharan Africa, the author finds that autocrats were significantly more likely to use a judicial strategy against insiders",0,1,3460,(x1: 172.59 y1: 32.83) (x2: 91.21 y2: 39.49),h1. | insiders are more likely to receive judicial repression.,h1. | insiders are more likely to receive judicial repression.,0,14 | 14,1694 | 1764,(x1: 111.00 y1: 406.16) (x2: 126.26 y2: 411.86) | (x1: 92.00 y1: 417.16) (x2: 291.17 y2: 422.86),"table 1 reports the main results from the logistic regression | insiders have a positive logit coefficient | sta- tistically significant at the 0.01 level and | robust to the inclusion of country, year, and regime controls.","Table 1 reports the main results from the logistic regression...insiders have a positive logit coefficient...statistically significant at the 0.01 level and...robust to the inclusion of country, year, and regime controls.

This article examines how the potential for large-scale external intervention can prevent civil wars. The author argues that intervention by external states in civil war can be so overwhelming that it reduces one side's probability of victory to essentially zero. When dissidents expect this type of intervention on the side of government, they anticipate no chance of achieving success through violence and do not initiate civil wars. When governments anticipate this type of intervention on their behalf, they feel protected from internal threat and are less constrained in their dealings with their populations. This repression increases grievances, leading dissidents to engage in strategies of dissent other than civil war. The author tests three implications of this argument-that states in more hierarchical relationships will experience civil war at lower rates, be more repressive, and experience other forms of dissent at higher rates-and finds strong support for it.","[Cunningham, David E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cunningham, David E.] Peace Res Inst Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Cunningham, DE (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Cunningham, DE (reprint author), Peace Res Inst Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",dacunnin@umd.edu,,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0043-8871,1086-3338,2016,68,2,10.1017/s0043887115000404,International Relations; Political Science,International Relations; Government & Law,WOS:000372406900004,307,Cunningham,David E.,16-Apr,Cunningham_WorldPolitics_2016_y96zb.pdf,The authortests | implications of this argument-that states in more hierarchical relationships will experience civil war at lower rates | -and finds strong support for it.,The authortests | implications of this argument-that states in more hierarchical relationships will experience civil war at lower rates | -and finds strong support for it.,0,1 | 1 | 1,3501 | 3523 | 3715,(x1: 312.62 y1: 37.23) (x2: 340.41 y2: 39.89) | (x1: 351.75 y1: 37.23) (x2: 163.42 y2: 43.89) | (x1: 295.70 y1: 41.23) (x2: 349.94 y2: 43.89),"Consistent with the expectations of the theory, i find that states in more hierarchi- cal relationships with the united States are | less likely to experience civil wars.","Consistent with the expectations of the theory, i find that states in more hierarchi- cal relationships with the united States are | less likely to experience civil wars.",0,3 | 3,903 | 1136,(x1: 322.04 y1: 87.96) (x2: 242.06 y2: 120.86) | (x1: 69.44 y1: 139.94) (x2: 232.68 y2: 146.85),"in the case of uS hierarchy, table 2 shows strong support for my argument that the potential for large-scale intervention on behalf of the government causes dissidents not to rebel violently, making civil war less likely. | Consistent with this argument, the statistical tests show that civil wars | are significantly less likely when states are in more hierarchical rela- tionships with the united States","In the case of US hierarchy, Table 2 shows strong support for my argument that the potential for large-scale intervention on behalf of the government causes dissidents not to rebel violently, making civil war less likely...Consistent with this argument, the statistical tests show that civil wars...are significantly less likely when states are in more hierarchical relationships with the United States...[Table 2, Internal Armed Conflicts, US security hierarchy_t-1 = -0.949, standard error = 0.358, p<0.01, two-tailed]",0,23 | 23 | 23,609 | 940 | 1033,(x1: 59.99 y1: 165.96) (x2: 113.53 y2: 211.86) | (x1: 275.26 y1: 217.94) (x2: 279.69 y2: 237.85) | (x1: 48.00 y1: 243.93) (x2: 197.53 y2: 263.84),table 2,"Table 2, Internal Armed Conflicts, US security hierarchy_t-1 = -0.949, standard error = 0.358, p<0.01, two-tailed",23,638,(x1: 196.48 y1: 165.96) (x2: 231.97 y2: 172.87),David E.

Because of the presence of group-level unobservables, standard quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, consisting of group-by-group quantile regression followed by two-stage least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero-mean normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor, 1981, micro-level covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous group-level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples.

We compare them to full insurance and exogenously incomplete financial regimes (autarky, saving only, borrowing and lending in a single asset). We develop computational methods based on mechanism design, linear programming, and maximum likelihood to estimate, compare, and statistically test these alternative dynamic models with financial/information constraints. Our methods can use both cross-sectional and panel data and allow for measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate the models using data on Thai households running small businesses from two separate samples. We find that in the rural sample, the exogenously incomplete saving only and borrowing regimes provide the best fit using data on consumption, business assets, investment, and income. Family and other networks help consumption smoothing there, as in a moral hazard constrained regime. In contrast, in urban areas, we find mechanism design financial/information regimes that are decidedly less constrained, with the moral hazard model fitting best combined business and consumption data. We perform numerous robustness checks in both the Thai data and in Monte Carlo simulations and compare our maximum likelihood criterion with results from other metrics and data not used in the estimation.

Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic model of policy implementation in order to examine the role of leadership commitment to reform in a staff's decision to use performance information. We then discuss some of the empirical implications of the theoretical model and examine a couple of them by analyzing data from a 2007 Government Accountability Office survey of federal agency managers.

An important part of the belief is that more effective communication can lead to more favorable media coverage that ultimately shapes citizen trust in government. However, the link between government communication and media coverage remains empirically untested. Through a survey of 881 government and business communicators, this study tests the relationship between external communication activities and media coverage. The study shows that government organizations report being less likely to have favorable news coverage than their private counterparts, but most government organizations do report that their media coverage is favorable. Moreover, the results show that active media interaction, organizational support for communication, and adequate communication budget are associated with reporting more favorable coverage. In comparison, a different set of variables, except adequate communication budget, are found to affect whether business organizations report having more favorable media coverage.","[Liu, Brooke Fisher] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Horsley, J.

A Behavioral Model of Innovative Search: Evidence from Public Hospital Services,Salge,T.

Extending behavioral arguments to the public sector context, it proposes that changes in innovative activity reflect either of two organizational search processes. The first process, commonly known as problemistic search, is triggered by negative performance feedback and initiated to identify appropriate solutions for the performance problem at hand. The second process is known as slack search. It is driven by the availability of excess resources, which decision makers seek to employ most fruitfully. In addition to these fundamental driving forces of innovative search, the proposed behavioral model attributes important moderating roles to organizational slack and regulatory endorsement. In particular, it suggests that public service organizations with high levels of available slack are most likely to engage in problemistic search following perceived performance shortfalls. Similarly, it is assumed that problemistic search is most salient among organizations with full regulatory endorsement. Conversely, when endorsement is low, slack search gains in importance. These behavioral propositions are tested based on novel panel data from the entire population of public nonspecialist hospital organizations in the English National Health Service. Findings from fixed-effects panel regression analyses offer broad support for the proposed behavioral model of innovative search, which has important implications for public administration research and practice.

Although conflict involving religion is often more violent and longer lasting than other forms of conflict, to date little research has examined the factors explaining the relevance of religion to conflict mobilization. Adopting a rational choice approach, I argue that religion is more likely to be a salient component of conflict when an ethnic group's religious leaders face local incentives to compete over adherents. I test this approach using a multi-method research design that combines statistical analysis of original time-series data on the salience of religion in conflict with qualitative evidence drawn from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Both types of analyses support the notion that competition among religious leaders can serve as a precursor to the mobilization of religious sentiment in conflict, which in turn exerts a tremendous influence on the intensity and duration of conflict.","[Isaacs, Matthew] Brandeis Univ, Polit Sci, Waltham, MA USA","Isaacs, M (reprint author), Olin Sang 204,415 South St, Waltham, MA 02453 USA.",mdisaacs@brandeis.edu,Tobin Project; Research Circle on Democracy and Cultural Pluralism at Brandeis University,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0010-4140,1552-3829,2017,50,2,10.1177/0010414016655534,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000392870200002,200-231,Isaacs,Matthew,17-Feb,Isaacs_CompPolitStu_2017_6yd6v.pdf,religion is more likely to be a salient component of conflict when an ethnic group’s religious leaders face local incentives to compete over adherents.,religion is more likely to be a salient component of conflict when an ethnic group’s religious leaders face local incentives to compete over adherents.,0,1,650,(x1: 139.71 y1: 276.01) (x2: 143.51 y2: 305.82),"Hypothesis 1: Religion is more likely to be salient in conflict for ethnic groups with fragmented religious organizations than for ethnic groups with a single religious organization, other factors being equal.","Hypothesis 1: Religion is more likely to be salient in conflict for ethnic groups with fragmented religious organizations than for ethnic groups with a single religious organization, other factors being equal.",0,7,2650,(x1: 54.00 y1: 517.39) (x2: 301.56 y2: 546.93),The findings presented in Table 1 confirm that the structural conditions favoring religious competition within an ethnic group are positively associ- ated with the salience of religion in conflict. | The significant positive coeffi- cient on Religious Structure in Model 1 indicates that a move from monopolistic religious organizations to fragmented religious organizations corresponds to a roughly 27% increase in the proportion of the group’s politi- cal organizations using religious rhetoric in conflict.,"The findings presented in Table 1 confirm that the structural conditions favoring religious competition within an ethnic group are positively associated with the salience of religion in conflict.

Although research has focused on the impacts of war on state building, the potential ""war-making effects"" of extraction have largely been neglected. The article provides the first quantitative analysis of these effects in the context of colonial state building. It focuses on the ""Maji Maji"" rebellion (1905-1907), the most substantial incidence of anticolonial violence in Eastern Africa. Analyses based on a new historical data set confirm the correlation between extraction and resistance. More importantly, they reveal that distinct strategies of extraction produced distinct outcomes. Although the intensification of extraction in state-held areas created grievances among the population, it did not drive the rebellion. Rather, the results indicate that the expansion of extractive authority threatened the interests of local elites and provoked effective resistance.

Such protests frequently turn violent, occasionally with major repercussions for political stability and the process of democratization. But, why do some political parties use legal avenues to reject electoral outcomes whereas others go outside of the established legal routes? Based on the original data from new democracies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from 1990 to 2009, I show that political parties are more likely to reject electoral outcomes using extra-legal means when election-related institutions have been changed prior to an election. This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for pre-election day factors when analyzing post-electoral disputes. It also contributes to the literature by presenting a new conceptual framework for studying electoral compliance.","Univ Oxford, Sch Interdisciplinary Area Studies, Oxford OX2 6LH, England","Chernykh, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sch Interdisciplinary Area Studies, 12 Bevington Rd, Oxford OX2 6LH, England.",svitlana.chernykh@lac.ox.ac.uk,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0010-4140,1552-3829,2014,47,10,10.1177/0010414013512597,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000341183100001,1359-1383,Chernykh,Svitlana,14-Sep,Chernykh_CompPolitStu_2014_yz5z3.pdf,I show that political parties are more likely to reject electoral outcomes using extra-legal means when election-related institutions have been changed prior to an election.,I show that political parties are more likely to reject electoral outcomes using extra-legal means when election-related institutions have been changed prior to an election.,0,1,856,(x1: 246.01 y1: 294.01) (x2: 332.71 y2: 323.82),"I argue that if the incumbent has changed the rules governing elections prior to the election, opposition political parties will be more likely to resort to extra-legal means when con- testing the outcomes of this election.","I argue that if the incumbent has changed the rules governing elections prior to the election, opposition political parties will be more likely to resort to extra-legal means when con- testing the outcomes of this election.",0,7,2486,(x1: 242.53 y1: 457.39) (x2: 194.66 y2: 498.93),"Second model estimates the probability of observing different types of rejection—compliance, legal rejection, or extra-legal rejection—if election- related institutions have been changed prior to an election. | Consistent with the theory proposed in this article, change in election-related rules increases the likelihood that political parties will use extra-legal means of rejection as opposed to pursuing only legal route of conflict resolution.","Second model estimates the probability of observing different types of rejection—compliance, legal rejection, or extra-legal rejection—if election-related institutions have been changed prior to an election...Consistent with the theory proposed in this article, change in election-related rules increases the likelihood that political parties will use extra-legal means of rejection as opposed to pursuing only legal route of conflict resolution.

However, few sources of data have been available to systematically examine the relationship between a leader's patronage strategies and the likelihood of an extraconstitutional change in power. This article employs ministerial appointments to the cabinet as a proxy for changes in the size of a leader's patronage coalition. With time-series cross-section data on 40 African countries, this study shows that the size of cabinets varies systematically according to regime type, resource constraints, ethnic fractionalization, and total population. It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments. A proportional hazards model of regime duration indicates that cabinet expansion lowers the probability of a leader's being deposed through a coup. The appointment of one additional minister to the cabinet lowers a leader's coup risk by a greater extent than does a 1-percentage-point increase in economic growth.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Arriola, LR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0010-4140,1552-3829,2009,42,10,10.1177/0010414009332126,Political Science,Government & Law,WOS:000269379500004,1339-1362,Arriola,Leonardo R.,9-Oct,Arriola_CompPolitStu_2009_r3k01.pdf,It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments.,It then shows that African leaders extend their tenure in office by expanding their patronage coalition through cabinet appointments.,0,1,770,(x1: 270.92 y1: 267.04) (x2: 208.15 y2: 294.05),I then show that patronage appointments to the cabinet can be used to extend a leader’s tenure.,I then show that patronage appointments to the cabinet can be used to extend a leader’s tenure.,0,3,843,(x1: 156.18 y1: 194.24) (x2: 248.97 y2: 211.82),Table 3 presents the results from the duration analysis. | The estimated effect for cabinet size is substantively and statistically significant across all specifications of the model.,"Table 3 presents the results from the duration analysis…The estimated effect for cabinet size is substantively and statistically significant across all specifications of the model.

Connected firms may in fact avoid fully complying with the costly norms implied by a law, a regulation, or a contract. At the same time, they can also credibly threaten to sue new entrants. Therefore, a change in the institutional environment that diminishes the ability of incumbent firms to establish judicial connections-i.e., an increase in judicial independence-can promote entrepreneurship. Exploiting reforms that change the way in which U.S. state judges are selected, we confirm that this is the case, and we show that this effect is more salient in states and industries where the likelihood of entering into a business dispute is higher.

This article examines three hypotheses about the processes producing these inequalities. The first argues that social class inequalities reflect differences across education groups in knowledge of the risks of smoking. The second suggests that the living conditions of lower social class groups leads to the development of lower self-efficacy and a lower propensity to quit smoking. The third states that smoking has a functional use among poorer individuals. This article draws upon data from the Republic of Ireland to assess these hypotheses. Our analysis provides some support for the first hypothesis in that education independently reduces the odds of a manual class person smoking relative to a non-manual by 12 per cent. The second hypothesis is not supported by the data. The third hypothesis gains the most support: measures of disadvantage and deprivation account for almost one-third of the class differential in smoking. The results suggest that smoking cessation policy should reflect the importance of social and economic context in quitting behaviour.","[Layte, Richard; Whelan, Christopher T.] ESRI, Dublin 2, Ireland","Layte, R (reprint author), ESRI, Whitaker Sq,Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Richard.layte@esri.ie,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2009,25,4,10.1093/esr/jcn022,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000268109700001,399-410,Layte,Richard,9-Aug,Layte_EurSocioRev_2009_n0b68.pdf,Our analysis provides some support for the first hypothesis in that education independently reduces the odds of a manual class person smoking relative to a non-manual by 12 per cent.,Our analysis provides some support for the first hypothesis in that education independently reduces the odds of a manual class person smoking relative to a non-manual by 12 per cent.,0,1,929,(x1: 418.84 y1: 334.85) (x2: 462.18 y2: 363.28),"The first hypothesis relates to the effect of education acting through knowledge differentials about the risks of smoking: The differential between social classes reflects differences in knowledge about the hazards of smok- ing, which result from differences in educational attainment across class groups.

The present study evaluated resting and stress-reactive respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) to a laboratory stressor as predictors of daily interpersonal stress generation and depressive symptoms, whether stress generation mediated the relationship between RSA and depressive symptoms, and potential sex differences. A sample of formerly depressed 102 emerging adults (18-22 years; 79% female) completed a laboratory stressor and daily assessments of stressors and depressive symptoms over 2 weeks. Multilevel modeling revealed that (a) lower resting RSA predicted daily depressive symptoms, (b) less RSA reactivity predicted interpersonal stress generation, (c) interpersonal dependent stressors mediated the relationship between RSA reactivity and daily depressive symptoms, and (d) sex differences occurred in the resting RSA-depression relationship. These findings highlight the importance of resting RSA and RSA reactivity in the examination of depression and interpersonal processes.","[Hamilton, Jessica L.; Alloy, Lauren B.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Hamilton, JL (reprint author), Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Weiss Hall,1701 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",Jessica.leigh.hamilton@temple.edu,National Institute of Mental Health [F31MH106184]; American Psychological Association; Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology; NIMH [MH101168],SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2167-7026,2167-7034,2017,5,6,10.1177/2167702617720211,"Psychology, Clinical",Psychology,WOS:000414040400001,911-929,Hamilton,Jessica L.,17-Nov,Hamilton_ClinPsychSci_2017_783kv.pdf,Multilevel modeling revealed that | lower resting RSA predicted daily depressive symptoms,Multilevel modeling revealed that | lower resting RSA predicted daily depressive symptoms,0,1 | 1,3507 | 3545,(x1: 363.90 y1: 309.65) (x2: 510.59 y2: 315.15) | (x1: 530.65 y1: 309.65) (x2: 259.65 y2: 327.15),we examined whether resting RSA | would predict higher levels of depressive symptoms | individual differences in RSA predict subsequent depressive symptoms among individuals with remitted depression,we examined whether resting RSA | would predict higher levels of depressive symptoms | individual differences in RSA predict subsequent depressive symptoms among individuals with remitted depression,0,4 | 4 | 12,544 | 651 | 1666,(x1: 161.14 y1: 178.52) (x2: 65.44 y2: 196.02) | (x1: 150.47 y1: 202.52) (x2: 149.10 y2: 220.02) | (x1: 331.55 y1: 322.52) (x2: 358.45 y2: 352.02),"In partial support of our hypotheses, only resting RSA predicted depressive symp- toms over the 2 weeks of daily diary assessments (Table 2).

However, many minimize the complexity of this transparency initiative and elevate the potential benefits. While BWCs can promote police accountability, they may also reduce citizen trust in police organizations. For BWCs to achieve win-win solutions, police organizations should determine the level of citizen support for specific BWC practices. However, measuring citizen support presents several challenges. Social desirability may impact polling results, as participants underreport responses they perceive to be outside the norm. The authors employ a list experiment design to measure true citizen support for BWC practices. They find statistically significant levels of social desirability for police discretion in the activation of BWCs and for restriction of footage accessibility regarding suspects with mental illness.

Despite the growing interest in recent years in emotional intelligence within the managerial literature, too little has been written about emotional intelligence within the public sector. This is surprising in light of New Public Management voices that stress flexibility, responsiveness, and a focus on the needs and demands of citizens. The functionality of the heart in a mind-oriented bureaucracy is analyzed, and a model is suggested for exploring the relationship between emotional intelligence, organizational politics, and employees' performance in public agencies. This model is empirically tested in two Israeli municipalities. The results support a moderating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship organizational politics and emotional commitment, as well as between organizational politics and employees' absenteeism. Other direct mediating effects of political perceptions and skills are noted. Implications for theory development, future empirical studies, as well as practical recommendations are suggested.","[Vigoda-Gadot, Eran] Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Vigoda-Gadot, Eran] Univ Haifa, Ctr Publ Management, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel","Vigoda-Gadot, E (reprint author), Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",eranv@poli.haifa.ac.il,,WILEY-BLACKWELL,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-3352,1540-6210,2010,70,1,10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02112.x,Public Administration,Public Administration,WOS:000274197600010,72-86,Vigoda-Gadot,Eran,JAN-FEB 2010,Vigoda-Gadot_PubAdminRev_2010_dx95v.pdf,The results support a moderating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between organizational politics and emotional commitment,The results support a moderating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between organizational politics and emotional commitment,0,1,3841,(x1: 220.56 y1: 378.60) (x2: 324.74 y2: 408.88),EI moderates the relationship between perceptions of politics and the outcome variables.,EI moderates the relationship between perceptions of politics and the outcome variables.,0,6,1108,(x1: 59.59 y1: 284.39) (x2: 177.03 y2: 302.75),"Table 4 presents a moderated multiple hierarchical regression analysis, with the inclusion of interaction eﬀects.

We argue that while equity is conducive to uncertain exploration critical for innovation, debt provides countervailing incentives for engaging in exploitation by imposing cash flow obligations and the threat of bankruptcy. As a consequence, debt becomes a vital instrument in directing innovation along the optimal trajectory, while preventing the balance from shifting too far toward suboptimal exploration. To support our arguments, drawing on patent data, we first demonstrate that a firm's leverage is positively related to knowledge exploitation activity as reflected in its self-citations. Next, we show that firms that have potentially engaged in suboptimal exploration, as manifest in underutilized stocks of proprietary knowledge, are likely to experience leverage increases in the short run, and these leverage increases in turn result in subsequent increases in self-citations. These effects are consistent with firm value indicating that equity holders value the role of debt in stimulating exploitation. Our study draws attention to the complementary roles of equity and debt as governance mechanisms in balancing exploration/exploitation, while outlining the role of debt in innovation in greater depth.","[Choi, Byungchul] Univ Nottingham, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kumar, M.

In particular, we investigate the impact of prior alliance experience on the performance implications of corporate acquisitions. We start with the simple suggestion that such experience spillovers will depend on the similarity among the managerial processes characterizing these activities. The empirical evidence confirms that the more the focal acquisition is managed in ways that are typical of partnerships (e. g., with low integration or with high relational quality levels), the more positive is the effect of past alliance experience on acquisition performance. However, we also find that alliance experience can be detrimental under certain circumstances, such as when the acquisition is managed with more aggressive post-acquisition integration approaches.

To operationalize cumulative structural disadvantage, this study uses data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in a Latent Class Analysis that demographically profiles health impairment trajectories. This analysis is used to examine the nature of selection as it relates to racial differences in the development of health impairments that are significant enough to hinder one's ability to work. The results provide no direct support for the race-based version of cumulative structural disadvantage theory. Instead, two key findings support the social class-based version of cumulative disadvantage theory. First, the functional form of the different health trajectories are invariant for whites and blacks, suggesting more racial similarly in the developmental process than anticipated by the race-based version of the theory. The extent of the racial disparity in the prevalences across the health impairment trajectories is, however, significant and noteworthy: nearly one-third of blacks (28 %) in the United States experience some form of impairment during their prime working years compared with 18.8 % of whites. Second, racial differences in childhood background mediate this racial health disparity through the indirect pathway of occupational attainment and through the direct pathway of early-life exposure to health-adverse environments. Thus, the selection of individuals into different health trajectories, based largely on childhood socioeconomic background, helps explain racial disparities in the development of health impairments.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Pais, J (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol, 344 Mansfield Rd,Unit 2068, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",j.pais@uconn.edu,,SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0070-3370,1533-7790,2014,51,5,10.1007/s13524-014-0330-9,Demography,Demography,WOS:000344321900008,1729-1753,Pais,Jeremy,14-Oct,Pais_Demography_2014_y9g8y.pdf,nearly one-third of blacks (28 %) in the United States experience some form of impairment during their prime working years compared with 18.8 % of whites.,nearly one-third of blacks (28 %) in the United States experience some form of impairment during their prime working years compared with 18.8 % of whites.,0,1,1489,(x1: 326.43 y1: 422.64) (x2: 271.61 y2: 451.95),that black representation among the relatively unhealthy trajectories will be significantly greater than whites.,that black representation among the relatively unhealthy trajectories will be significantly greater than whites.,0,6,731,(x1: 165.88 y1: 179.76) (x2: 254.26 y2: 197.12),"Table 3 examines the extent of racial disparity across the five health trajectories | As anticipated, blacks are underrepresented in the healthy class (72.0 % of blacks vs. 81.2 % of whites)","Table 3 examines the extent of racial disparity across the five health trajectories...As anticipated, blacks are underrepresented in the healthy class (72.0% of blacks vs. 81.2% of whites)...[Table 3, Latent Class Prevalence, Healthy (%): Non-Hispanic White = 81.2, Non-Hispanic Black = 72.0; p < .001]",0,13 | 13,2406 | 2557,(x1: 62.36 y1: 406.93) (x2: 371.70 y2: 412.32) | (x1: 301.49 y1: 418.84) (x2: 369.05 y2: 436.19),Table 3 | Latent Class Prevalence | Non-Hispanic White | Non-Hispanic Black | Healthy (%) | 81.2 | 72.0*** | ***p < .001,"Table 3, Latent Class Prevalence, Healthy (%): Non-Hispanic White = 81.2, Non-Hispanic Black = 72.0; p < .001",15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 15,1372,(x1: 51.02 y1: 58.74) (x2: 76.44 y2: 63.10) | (x1: 195.59 y1: 89.74) (x2: 269.88 y2: 94.06) | (x1: 195.59 y1: 109.92) (x2: 259.73 y2: 114.24) | (x1: 289.53 y1: 109.92) (x2: 352.96 y2: 114.24) | (x1: 51.42 y1: 130.56) (x2: 89.54 y2: 134.88) | (x1: 205.92 y1: 130.56) (x2: 219.60 y2: 134.88) | (x1: 299.85 y1: 130.56) (x2: 325.10 y2: 134.88) | (x1: 85.89 y1: 381.37) (x2: 124.25 y2: 385.69),Jeremy Pais,j.pais@uconn.edu,1,06odn

The authors show that this disparity is not plausibly due to racial preferences in the electorate as a whole, for instance, deference toward white candidates or discrimination against nonwhites, and that barriers to candidate entry or discrimination by party leaders do not likely explain the gap. Instead, they document persistent resource disparities between white and nonwhite candidates, including large differences in personal assets and campaign contributions. The findings suggest that elite closure-investments by racial and economic elites on behalf of elite candidates-help perpetuate a white political class, even in the absence of racialized politics.

Historically, Protestantism has also been linked to generating a political culture that promotes individualism, tolerance, the pluralism of ideas, and civic associationalism. Recent empirical evidence also shows how Protestant countries are more likely to be democratic compared to largely Islamic and Catholic states. Drawing from established cultural theories, the author empirically tests the argument whether or not transitional states with larger Protestant populations are more likely to strengthen their democracies. Findings indicate that transitional states that have higher Protestant populations are more likely to have higher levels of voice and accountability, political stability, citizenship empowerment, and civil society pluralism.

The results from an accelerated failure time model indicate that more controversial claims lead to slower grants but faster withdrawals, whereas well-documented applications are approved faster and withdrawn more slowly. We find strong evidence that applicants accelerate grant proceedings for their most valuable patents, but that they also prolong the battle for such patents if a withdrawal or refusal is imminent.

Using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003 in 30 nations, we focus on social cleavages in mid-adolescents access and use of digital technologies, taking into account both individual-level and country-level influences. Our study shows that adolescents from higher socio-economic and two-parent family households are more likely to have Internet access at home. Additionally, adolescents from higher-status families use the Internet more often for informational purposes than children from lower-status families. Adolescents from single-parent are less likely to have home Internet access. Nevertheless, they use the Internet more frequently for information and communication and play computer games more often than their peers living in two-parent families. Testing simultaneously individual and country characteristics shows that a countrys level of modernization can be separated into compositional and contextual effects. Overall, a countrys level of modernization only affects whether digital applications are available at the family home, but not how they are used. These findings suggest that once a family has access to the Internet, the digital use patterns of their adolescent children do not differ across nations.","[Notten, Natascha; Kraaykamp, Gerbert] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Peter, Jochen; Valkenburg, Patti M.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Notten, N (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",n.notten@maw.ru.nl,,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-7215,1468-2672,2009,25,5,10.1093/esr/jcn071,Sociology,Sociology,WOS:000270218200003,551-560,Notten,Natascha,9-Oct,Notten_EurSocioRev_2009_xr516.pdf,adolescents from higher socio-economic | households are more likely to have Internet access at home.,adolescents from higher socio-economic | households are more likely to have Internet access at home.,0,1 | 1,603 | 664,(x1: 380.17 y1: 301.96) (x2: 162.51 y2: 318.50) | (x1: 265.20 y1: 313.93) (x2: 137.25 y2: 330.40),our results show that adolescents from higher-status | households are more likely to have home Internet access than adolescents from other families.,our results show that adolescents from higher-status | households are more likely to have home Internet access than adolescents from other families.,0,7 | 7,1994 | 2069,(x1: 196.55 y1: 515.95) (x2: 195.49 y2: 531.55) | (x1: 86.97 y1: 538.29) (x2: 260.99 y2: 553.88),Table 1 shows | adolescents | with parents who have a higher occupational status have significantly higher odds of digital access at home than adolescents from lower socio-economic families.,"Table 1 shows…adolescents…with parents who have a higher occupational status have significantly higher odds of digital access at home than adolescents from lower socio-economic families.

Realizing Challenges and Guarding Against Threats: Interactive Effects of Regulatory Focus and Stress on Performance,Byron,Kris,2018,10.1177/0149206316658349,0149-2063,Journal of Management,JournManage,Journal of Management,FALSE,"Byron, Kris; Peterson, Suzanne J.; Zhang, Zhen; LePine, Jeffery A.",Realizing Challenges and Guarding Against Threats: Interactive Effects of Regulatory Focus and Stress on Performance,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,English,stress; regulatory focus; challenge stressors; hindrance stressors; self-regulation; job performance,CORE SELF-EVALUATIONS; ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICS; JOB CONTROL; PREVENTION; MOTIVATION; PROMOTION; WORK; BEHAVIOR; FEEDBACK; OUTCOMES,"Self-regulation seems crucial to understanding how employees perform under stress because employees must regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior to deal effectively with work stress. Integrating regulatory focus theory and the challenge-hindrance stressor framework, we theorized that the effects of regulatory focus on job performance would vary as a function of the level of stress employees experience. Specifically, we contend that employees are more efficacious and motivated (and thus perform better) when they have established goal and coping strategies that allow them to cope with the stress they face; those lacking in these strategies are likely to find the stress overwhelming and taxing (and perform worse). Using multisource data of 160 salespersons, we investigated this relationship with two measures of job performance. We found that challenge stress moderates the relationship between promotion focus and job performance: When challenge stress is high, promotion focus is positively related to job performance; when low, promotion focus is negatively or not significantly related to job performance. We also found that hindrance stress moderates the relationship between prevention focus and job performance: When hindrance stress is low, prevention focus is negatively related to job performance, but when high, prevention focus is positively related to job performance. Moreover, we find some support for three-way interactions suggesting that using mismatched goal and coping strategies is especially harmful. Our results explain performance differences in high-stress situations and highlight the important role of self-regulation when employees are in stressful conditions.","[Byron, Kris] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Peterson, Suzanne J.; Zhang, Zhen; LePine, Jeffery A.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Byron, K (reprint author), Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Dept Managerial Sci, POB 4014, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",kbyron@gsu.edu,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0149-2063,1557-1211,2018,44,8,10.1177/0149206316658349,"Business; Psychology, Applied; Management",Business & Economics; Psychology,WOS:000446343100002,3011-3037,Byron,Kris,18-Nov,Byron_JournManage_2018_0p1bd.pdf,"We found that challenge stress moderates the relationship between promotion focus and job performance: When challenge stress is high, promotion focus is positively related to job performance; when low, promotion focus is negatively or not significantly related to job per- formance.","We found that challenge stress moderates the relationship between promotion focus and job performance: When challenge stress is high, promotion focus is positively related to job performance; when low, promotion focus is negatively or not significantly related to job per- formance.",0,1,1301,(x1: 89.97 y1: 447.07) (x2: 98.60 y2: 485.05),Challenge stress moderates the relationship between employee promotion focus and job performance such that employee promotion focus is more strongly positively related to job performance when challenge stress is high (as compared to low).,Challenge stress moderates the relationship between employee promotion focus and job performance such that employee promotion focus is more strongly positively related to job performance when challenge stress is high (as compared to low).,0,6,432,(x1: 114.32 y1: 146.95) (x2: 307.44 y2: 173.92),"The interaction term (Promotion Focus × Challenge Stress) was statistically signifi- cant for manager-rated performance (b= .21, SEb = .09, p< .05)","The interaction term (Promotion Focus × Challenge Stress) was statistically significant for manager-rated performance (b = .21, SE_b = .09, p < .05)...",0,14,3597,(x1: 81.15 y1: 580.40) (x2: 305.46 y2: 597.94),"b= .21, SEb = .09, p< .05","b = .21, SE_b = .09, p < .05",14,3718,(x1: 199.81 y1: 592.40) (x2: 302.13 y2: 597.94),Kris Byron,kbyron@gsu.edu,1,q3jq6

This paper addresses the question by exploiting a unique database from a Senegalese network of 36 financial cooperatives. We scrutinize the loan-granting decisions, made jointly by the locally elected board and the top manager assigned by the central union of the network. Our findings are threefold. First, female-dominated boards favor social orientation. Second, female managers tend to align their strategy with local boards' preferences. Third, the central union tends to assign male managers to female-dominated boards, probably to curb the boards' 'social orientation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
